Vehicle emissions, another source of air pollution, get worsened by fuel adulteration and poor fuel combustion efficiencies from traffic congestion. Factories pollute air through fossil fuel emissions. These emissions include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.Air pollution is the main cause for the monsoon to be delayed. Air pollution is the major cause for several health hazards. It damages vegetation and animal life too.Steps must be taken to clean smoke stacks and exhaust pipes in factories. Vehicles must be checked periodically and maintained meticulously. We can opt  for renewable or alternative energy sources. Using such renewable and sustainable energy sources reduces pollution. Creating awareness is the remedial measure to check pollution. We as responsible citizens, must willingly contribute to the reduction of air pollution.

He had searched every inch, rooting among the rough, dirt-caked straw nest where he and his brothers and sister had been hatched. He even gnawed  at the dried pieces of eggshell. It was like eating a part of himself.He then trotted  back and forth from one end of the ledge to the other, his long gray legs stepping daintily, trying to find some means of reaching his parents without having to fly. But on each side of him, the ledge ended in a sheer fall of precipice , with the sea beneath. And between him and his parents, there was a deep, wide crack.Surely he could reach them without flying if he could only move northwards along the cliff face? But then, on what c.  What was the first catch of the young seagull’s older brother?d.  What did the young seagull manage to find in his search for food on the ledge?could he walk? There was no ledge, and he was not a fly. And above him, he could see nothing. The precipice was sheer, and the top of it was, perhaps, farther away than  the sea beneath him.He stepped slowly out to the brink of the ledge, and, standing on one leg with the other leg hidden under his wing, he closed one eye, then the other, and pretended to be falling asleep. Still, they took no notice of him. He saw his two brothers and his sister lying on the plateau dozing, with their heads sunk into their necks. His father was preening the feathers on his white back. Only his mother was looking at him.She was standing on a little high hump on the plateau, her white breast thrust forward. Now and again, she tore at a piece of fish that lay at her feet, and then scraped each side of her beak on the rock. The sight of the food maddened him. How he loved to tear food that way, scraping his beak now and again to whet  it! He uttered a low cackle. His mother cackled too, and looked at him.10th English_Unit_1.indd3 28-11-202218:18:43www.tntextbooks.in'"

              " 2The young seagull was alone on his ledge. His two brothers and his sister had already flown away the day before. He had been afraid to fly with them. Somehow, when he had taken a little run forward to the brink of the ledge and attempted to flap his wings, he became afraid. The great expanse of sea stretched down beneath, and it was such a long way down – miles down. He felt certain that his wings would never support him; so he bent his head and ran away back to the little hole under the ledge where he slept at night.Even when each of his brothers and his little sister, whose wings were far shorter than his own, ran to the brink, flapped their wings, and flew away, he failed to muster up courage to take that plunge which appeared to him so desperate. His father and mother had come around calling to him shrilly , scolding him, threatening to let him starve on his ledge, unless he flew away. But for the life of him, he could not move.That was twenty-four hours ago. Since then, nobody had come near him. The day before, all day long, he had watched his parents flying about with his brothers and sister, perfecting them in the art of flight, teaching them how to skim the waves and how to dive for fish. He had, in a. Why did the seagull fail to fly?b.  What did the parents do, when the young seagull failed to fly?fact, seen his older brother catch his first herring and devour it, standing on a rock, while his parents circled around raising a proud cackle . And all the morning, the whole family had walked about on the big plateau midway down the opposite cliff, laughing at his cowardice.The sun was now ascending the sky, blazing warmly on his ledge that faced the south. He felt the heat because he had not eaten since the previous nightfall. Then, he had found a dried  piece of mackerel ’sProse 1His First FlightLiam O’Flaherty10th English_Unit_1.indd2 28-11-202218:18:42www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 3tail at the far end of his ledge. Now, there was not a single scrap of food left. He had searched every inch, rooting among the rough, dirt-caked straw nest where he and his brothers and sister had been hatched. He even gnawed  at the dried pieces of eggshell. It was like eating a part of himself.He then trotted  back and forth from one end of the ledge to the other, his long gray legs stepping daintily, trying to find some means of reaching his parents without having to fly. But on each side of him, the ledge ended in a sheer fall of precipice , with the sea beneath. And between him and his parents, there was a deep, wide crack.Surely he could reach them without flying if he could only move northwards along the cliff face? But then, on what c.  What was the first catch of the young seagull’s older brother?d.  What did the young seagull manage to find in his search for food on the ledge?could he walk? There was no ledge, and he was not a fly. And above him, he could see nothing. The precipice was sheer, and the top of it was, perhaps, farther away than  the sea beneath him.He stepped slowly out to the brink of the ledge, and, standing on one leg with the other leg hidden under his wing, he closed one eye, then the other, and pretended to be falling asleep. Still, they took no notice of him. He saw his two brothers and his sister lying on the plateau dozing, with their heads sunk into their necks. His father was preening the feathers on his white back. Only his mother was looking at him.She was standing on a little high hump on the plateau, her white breast thrust forward. Now and again, she tore at a piece of fish that lay at her feet, and then scraped each side of her beak on the rock. The sight of the food maddened him. How he loved to tear food that way, scraping his beak now and again to whet  it! He uttered a low cackle. His mother cackled too, and looked at him.10th English_Unit_1.indd3 28-11-202218:18:43www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 4‘Ga, ga, ga, ’ he cried, begging her to bring him over some food. ‘Gawl-ool-ah, ’ she screamed back mockingly. But he kept calling plaintively , and after a minute or so, he uttered a joyful scream. His mother had picked up a piece of fish and was flying across to him with it. He leaned out eagerly, tapping the rock with his feet, trying to get nearer to her as she flew across. But when she was just opposite to him, abreast of the ledge, she halted, her legs hanging limp, her wings motionless, the piece of fish in her beak almost within reach of his beak.He waited a moment in surprise, wondering why she did not come nearer, and then maddened by hunger, he dived at the fish. With a loud scream, he fell outwards and downwards into space. His mother had swooped  upwards. As he passed beneath her, he heard the swish of her wings.Then a monstrous terror seized him and his heart stood still. He could hear nothing. But it only lasted a moment. The next moment, he felt his wings spread outwards. The wind rushed against his breast feathers, then under his stomach and against his wings. He could feel the tips of his wings cutting through the air. e.  What did the young bird do to seek the attention of his parents?f. What made the young seagull go mad?g.  Why did the young bird utter a joyful scream?h.  Did the mother bird offer any food to the young bird?He was not falling headlong now. He was soaring gradually, downwards and outwards. He was no longer afraid. He just felt a bit dizzy. Then, he flapped his wings once and he soared upwards.He uttered a delightful scream and flapped them again. He soared higher. He raised his breast and banked against the wind. ‘Ga, ga, ga. Ga, ga, ga. ’ ‘Gawlool-ah. ’ His mother swooped past him, her wings making a loud noise. He answered her with another scream. Then, his father flew over him screaming. Then, he saw his two brothers and sister flying around him, soaring and diving.Then, he completely forgot that he had not always been able to fly, and commenced to dive and soar, shrieking shrilly.He was near the sea now, flying straight over it, facing out over the ocean.

Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow.BUNGEE-JUMPING Bungee Jumping is an activity that involves jumping from a tall structure while connected to a long elastic cord. The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a  movable object, such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to hover above the ground. The thrill comes from the free-falling and the rebound. When the person jumps, the cord stretches and the jumper flies upwards again as the cord recoils, and continues to oscillate up and down until all the kinetic energy is dissipated.Jumping Heights, located in Mohan Chatti village, in Rishikesh has been rated as one of the most preferred Bungee Jumping destinations in India at a height of 83 meters. It is the only place in India where Bungee Jumping can be done from a fixed platform. This is also India’s only fixed platform Bungee performed from a professional cantilever, to separate it from entertainment parks, and create instead, an extreme adventure zone. The Bungee has been designed by David Allardice of New Zealand.The Cantilever platform is built over a rocky cliff over-looking the river Hall, a tributary of River Ganges. Bungee-ing amidst the vastness of nature lends an absolutely breath taking experience. 10th English_Unit_1.indd8 28-11-202218:18:44www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

She came to this island so young, that she had no memory of having seen any other human face than her father’s.They lived in a cave made out of a rock; it was divided into several apartments, one of which Prospero called his study; there he kept his books, which chiefly treated of magic. By virtue of his art, he had released many good spirits from a witch called Sycorax who had them imprisoned in the bodies of large trees. These gentle spirits were ever after obedient to the will of Prospero. Of these Ariel was the chief.Ariel took rather too much pleasure in tormenting an ugly monster called Caliban, because he was the son of his old enemy Sycorax. Caliban was employed like a slave, to fetch wood, and do the most laborious offices; and Ariel had the charge of compelling him to these services.With the help of these spirits, Prospero could command the winds, and the waves of the sea. By his orders they raised a violent storm, in the midst of which, he showed his daughter a fine large ship, which he told her was full of living beings like themselves. “Oh my dear father, ” said she, “if by your art you have raised this dreadful storm, have pity on their sad distress. See! the vessel will be dashed to pieces. Poor souls! they will all perish. ”“Be not so amazed, daughter Miranda, ” said Prospero; “there is no harm done. I have so ordered it, that no person in the ship shall receive any hurt. What I have done has been in care of you, my dear child. Y ou are ignorant. Can you remember a time before you came to this cell? I think you cannot, for you were not then three years of age. ”10th English_Unit_1.indd21 28-11-202218:18:48www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 22“Twelve years ago, Miranda, ” continued Prospero, “I was Duke  of Milan, and you were a princess, and my only heir. I had a younger brother, whose name was Antonio, to whom I trusted everything; My brother Antonio being thus in possession of my power, began to think himself the duke indeed. The opportunity I gave him of making himself popular among my subjects awakened in his bad nature a proud ambition to deprive me of my dukedom: this he soon effected with the aid of the King of Naples, a powerful prince, who was my enemy. ”“Wherefore, ” said Miranda, “did they not that hour destroy us?”“My child, ” answered her father, “they dared not, so dear was the love that my people bore me. Antonio carried us on board a ship, and when we were some leagues out at sea, he forced us into a small boat, without either tackle, sail, or mast: there he left us, as he thought, to perish. But a kind lord of my court, one Gonzalo, who loved me, had privately placed in the boat, water, provisions, apparel, and some books which I prize above my dukedom. ”“O my father, ” said Miranda, “what a trouble must I have been to you then!”“No, my love, ” said Prospero, “you were a little angel that did preserve me. Y our innocent smiles made me bear up against my misfortunes. Our food lasted till we landed on this desert island, since when my chief delight has been in teaching you, Miranda, and well have you profited by my instructions. ”“Heaven thank you, my dear father, ” said Miranda. “Now tell me, sir, your reason for raising this sea-storm?”“Know then, ” said her father, “that by means of this storm, my enemies, the King of Naples, and my cruel brother, are cast ashore upon this island. ”Having so said, Prospero gently touched his daughter with his magic wand, and she fell fast asleep; for the spirit Ariel just then presented himself before his master, to give an account of the tempest, and how he had disposed of the ship’s company, and though the spirits were always invisible to Miranda, Prospero did not choose she should hear him holding conversation (as would seem to her) with the empty air.“Well, my brave spirit, ” said Prospero to Ariel, “how have you performed your task?”Ariel gave a lively description of the storm, and of the terrors of the mariners; and how the king’s son, Ferdinand, was the first who leaped into the sea; and his father thought he saw his dear son swallowed up by the waves and lost. “But he is safe, ” said Ariel, “in a corner of the isle, sadly lamenting the loss of the king, his father.“That’s my delicate Ariel, ” said Prospero. “Bring him here: my daughter must see this young prince. Where is the king, and my brother?”“I left them, ” answered Ariel, “searching for Ferdinand, whom they have little hopes of finding, thinking they saw 10th English_Unit_1.indd22 28-11-202218:18:48www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 23him perish. Of the ship’s crew not one is missing; though each one thinks himself the only one saved: and the ship, though invisible to them, is safe in the harbour. ”Ariel then went to fetch Ferdinand.“O my young gentleman, ” said Ariel, when he saw him, “I will soon move you. Y ou must be brought, I find, for the Lady Miranda to have a sight of your pretty person. Come, sir, follow me. ”He followed in amazement the sound of Ariel’s voice, till it led him to Prospero and Miranda, who were sitting under the shade of a large tree. Now Miranda had never seen a man before, except her own father.“Miranda, ” said Prospero, “tell me what you are looking at yonder. ”“O father, ” said Miranda, in a strange surprise, “surely that is a spirit. Lord! How it looks about! Believe me,  it is a beautiful creature. Is it not a spirit?”“No, girl, ” answered her father; “it eats, and sleeps, and has senses such as we have. This young man you see was in the ship. He is somewhat altered by grief, or you might call him a handsome person. He has lost his companions, and is wandering about to find them. ”Miranda, who thought all men had grave faces and grey beards like her father, was delighted with the appearance of this beautiful young prince; and Ferdinand, seeing such a lovely lady in this desert place, and from the strange sounds he had heard, expecting nothing but wonders, thought he was upon an enchanted island, and that Miranda was the goddess of the place, and as such he began to address her.She timidly answered, she was no goddess, but a simple maid, and was going to give him an account of herself, when Prospero interrupted her. He was well pleased to find they admired each other, but to try Ferdinand’s constancy, he resolved to throw some difficulties in their way: therefore advancing forward, he addressed the prince with a stern air, telling him, he came to the island as a spy, to take it from him who was the lord of it. “Follow me, ” said he, “I will tie your neck and feet together. Y ou shall drink sea-water; shell-fish, withered roots, and husks of acorns shall be your food. ” “No, ” said Ferdinand, “I will resist this” and drew his sword; but Prospero, waving his magic wand, fixed him to the spot where he stood, so that he had no power to move.Miranda hung upon her father, saying, “Why are you so ungentle? Have pity, sir; I will be his surety. This is the second man I ever saw, and to me he seems a true one. ”“Silence, ” said the father: “one word more will make me chide you, girl! What! An advocate for an impostor! Y ou think there are no more such fine men, having seen only him and Caliban. ” This he said to prove his daughter’s constancy; and she replied, “My affections are most humble. I have no wish to see a goodlier man. ”“Come on, young man, ” said Prospero to the Prince; “you have no power to disobey me. ”10th English_Unit_1.indd23 28-11-202218:18:48www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 24Prospero had commanded Ferdinand to pile up some heavy logs of wood. Kings’ sons not being much used to laborious work, Miranda soon after found him almost dying with fatigue . “ Alas!” said she, “do not work so hard; my father is at his studies, he is safe for these three hours; pray rest yourself. ”“O my dear lady, ” said Ferdinand, “I dare not. I must finish my task before I take my rest. ”“If you will sit down, ” said Miranda, “I will carry your  logs  the  while. ”  But  this Ferdinand would by no means agree to.Prospero, who had enjoined Ferdinand this task merely as a trial of his love, was not at his books, as his daughter supposed, but was standing by them invisible, to overhear what they said.Ferdinand inquired her name, which she told, saying it was against her father’s express command she did so.And then Ferdinand, in a fine long speech, told the innocent Miranda he was heir to the crown of Naples, and that she should be his queen.Prospero then appeared before them.“Fear nothing, my child, ” said he; “I have overheard, and approve of all you have said. And, Ferdinand, if I have too severely used you, I will make you rich amends, by giving my daughter in marriage to you. All your vexations were but trials of your love, and you have nobly stood the test. When Prospero left them, he called his spirit Ariel, who quickly appeared before him, eager to relate what he had done with Prospero’s brother and the King of Naples. Ariel said he had left them almost out of their senses with fear, at the strange things he had caused them to see and hear. When fatigued with wandering about, and famished  for want of food, he had suddenly set before them a delicious banquet, and then, just as they were going to eat, he appeared visible before them in the shape of a harpy, a voracious monster with wings, and the feast vanished away. Then, to their utter amazement, this seeming harpy spoke to them, reminding them of their cruelty in driving Prospero from his dukedom, and leaving him and his infant daughter to perish in the sea; saying, that for this cause these terrors were suffered to afflict them.The King of Naples, and Antonio the false brother, repented the injustice they had done to Prospero.“Then bring them here, Ariel, ” said Prospero.Ariel soon returned with the king, Antonio, and old Gonzalo. This Gonzalo was the same who had so kindly provided Prospero formerly with books and 10th English_Unit_1.indd24 28-11-202218:18:48www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 25provisions, when his wicked brother left him, as he thought, to perish in an open boat in the sea.Grief and terror had so stupefied their senses, that they did not know Prospero. He first discovered himself to the good old Gonzalo, calling him the preserver of his life; and then his brother and the king knew that he was the injured Prospero.Antonio with tears, and sad words of sorrow and true repentance, implored his brother’s forgiveness and Prospero forgave them; and, upon their engaging to restore his dukedom, he said to the King of Naples, “I have a gift in store for you too;” and opening a door, showed him his son Ferdinand playing chess with Miranda.Nothing could exceed the joy of the father and the son at this unexpected meeting, for they each thought the other drowned in the storm.The King of Naples was almost as much astonished at the beauty and excellent graces of the young Miranda, as his son had been. “Who is this maid?” said he; “She is the daughter to this Prospero, who is the famous Duke of Milan, of whose renown I have heard so much, but never saw him till now: of him I have received a new life: he has made himself to me a second father, giving me this dear lady, ” said Ferdinand“No more of that, ” said Prospero: “let us not remember our troubles past, since they so happily have ended. ” And then Prospero embraced his brother, and again assured him of his forgiveness.Prospero now told them that their ship was safe in the harbour, and the sailors all on board her, and that he and his daughter would accompany them home the next morning.Before Prospero left the island, he dismissed Ariel from his service, to the great joy of that lively little spirit.About the authorWilliam Shakespeare  (1564–1616) was  born in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. He was an English poet, playwright and actor. He is widely regarded as both the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. His surviving body of work includes 37 plays, 154 sonnets and two narrative poems, the majority of which he penned between  1589 and 1613.v The play 'The Tempest' was written between 1610 and 1611. v Many critics and historians believe it to be one of the last plays of  William Shakespeare. v It is considered to be one of Shakespeare's well-written plays.v It is believed that the play 'The Tempest' was based on an actual wreck of a ship called Sea Venture off Bermuda that was headed to Virginia. There is a strong evidence that Shakespeare used elements of the story of the wreck.10th English_Unit_1.indd25 28-11-202218:18:49www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

              " 30Imagination of odd things always leads to absolute humour. Read the lesson and enjoy the narrator's experience with his grandfather who creates chaos and laughter with his imaginative stories.The ghost that got into our house on the night of November 17, 1915, raised such a hullabaloo  of misunderstandings that I am sorry I didn’t just let it keep on walking, and go to bed. Its advent caused my mother to throw a shoe through a window of the house next door and ended up with my grandfather shooting a patrolman . I am sorry, therefore, as I have said, that I ever paid any attention to the footsteps.They began about a quarter past one o’ clock in the morning, a rhythmic, quick-cadenced walking around the dining-room table. My mother was asleep in one room upstairs, my brother-Herman in another, grandfather was in the attic , in the old walnut bed which, as you will remember, once fell on my father. I had just stepped out of the bathtub and was busily rubbing myself with a towel when I heard the steps. They were the steps of a man walking rapidly around the dining-table downstairs. The light from the bathroom shone down the back-steps, which dropped directly into the dining-room; I could see the faint shine of plates on the plate-rail; I couldn’t see the table. The steps kept going round and round the table; at regular intervals a board creaked, when it was trod upon. I supposed at first that it was my father or my brother Roy, who had gone to Indianapolis but were expected home at any time. I suspected next that it was a burglar. It did not enter my mind until later that it was a ghost.After the walking had gone on for perhaps three minutes, I tiptoed to Herman’s room. ‘Psst!’ I hissed, in the dark, shaking him. ‘ Awp’ , he said, in the low, hopeless tone of a despondent beagle – he always half suspected that something would ‘get him’ in the night. I told him who I was. ‘There’s something downstairs!’ I said. He got up and followed me to the head of the back staircase. The steps had ceased. Herman looked at me in some alarm: I had only the bath towel around my waist. He wanted to go back to bed, I gripped his arm.‘There’s something down there!’ I said. Instantly the steps began again, circled the dining-room table like a man running, and started up the stairs towards us, heavily, two at a time. The light still shone palely down the stairs; we saw nothing coming; we only heard the steps. Herman rushed to his room and slammed  the door. I slammed shut the door at the stairs top and held my knee against it. a.  Where was the author when he heard the noise?b.  What did the narrator think the unusual sound was?

              " 31After a long minute, I slowly opened it again. There was nothing there. There was no sound. None of us ever heard the ghost again.The slamming of the doors had aroused mother: she peered out of her room. ‘What on earth are you boys doing?’ she demanded. Herman ventured out of his room. ‘Nothing, ’ he said, gruffly , but he was, in colour, a light green. ‘What was all that running around downstairs?’ said mother. So she had heard the steps, too! We just looked at her. ‘Burglars!’ she shouted, intuitively . I tried to quieten her by starting lightly downstairs.‘Come on, Herman, ’ I said.‘I’ll stay with mother, ’ he said. ‘She’s all excited. ’ I stepped back onto the landing.‘Don’t either of you go a step, ’ said mother. ‘We’ll call the police. ’ Since the phone was downstairs, I didn’t see how we were going to call the police -- nor did I want the police – but mother made one of her quick, incomparable decisions. She flung up a window of her bedroom which faced the bedroom windows of the house of a neighbour, picked up a shoe, and whammed  it through a pane of glass across the narrow space that separated the two houses. Glass tinkled into the bedroom occupied by a retired engraver named Bodwell and his wife. Bodwell had been for some years in rather a bad way and was subject to mild ‘attacks’ . Almost everybody we knew or lived near had some kind of attacks.It was now about two o’ clock of a moonless night; clouds hung black and low. Bodwell was at the window in a minute, shouting frothing a little, shaking his fist. ‘We’ll sell the house and go back to Peoria, ’ we could hear Mrs. Bodwell saying. It was some time before mother ‘got through’ to Bodwell. ‘Burglars!’ she shouted. ‘Burglars in the house!’ Herman and I hadn’t dared to tell her that it was not burglars but ghosts, for she was even more afraid of ghosts than of burglars. Bodwell at first thought that she meant there were burglars in his house, but finally he quieted down and called the police for us over an extension phone by his bed. After he had disappeared from the window, mother suddenly made as if to throw another shoe, not because there was further need of it but, as she later explained, because the thrill of heaving a shoe through a window glass had enormously taken her fancy. I prevented her.The police were on hand in a commendably short time: a Ford sedan full of them, two on motorcycles, and a patrol wagon with about eight in it and a few reporters. They began banging at our c.  What were the various sounds the brothers heard when they went downstairs?d.

              " 32front door. Flashlights shot streaks of gleam up and down the walls, across the yard, down the walk between our house and Bodwell’s. ‘Open up!’ cried a hoarse voice. ‘We’re men from Headquarters!’ I wanted to go down and let them in, since there they were, but mother wouldn’t hear of it. ‘Y ou haven’t a stitch on, ’ she pointed out. ‘Y ou’ d catch your death. ’ I wound the towel around me again. Finally the cops put their shoulders to our big heavy front door with its thick bevelled  glass and broke it in: I could hear a rending of wood and a splash of glass on the floor of the hall. Their lights played all over the living-room and crisscrossed nervously in the dining-room, stabbed into hallways, shot up the front stairs and finally up the back. They caught me standing in my towel at the top. A heavy policeman bounded up the steps. ‘Who are you?’ he demanded. ‘I live here, ’ I said.The officer in charge reported to mother. ‘No sign of nobody, lady, ’ he said. ‘Musta got away – whatt’ d he like?’ ‘There were two or three of them, ’ mother said, ‘whooping and carrying on slamming doors. ’ ‘Funny, ’ said the cop. ‘ All ya windows and door was locked on the inside tight as a tick. ’ Downstairs, we could hear the tromping of the other police. Police were all over the place; doors were yanked  open, drawers were yanked e.  How did the Bodwells react, when a shoe was thrown into their house?f.  What did the Bodwells think when they heard the mother shout?open, windows were shot up and pulled down, furniture fell with dull thumps. A half-dozen policemen emerged out of the darkness of the front hallway upstairs. They began to ransack the floor; pulled beds away from walls, tore clothes off hooks in the closets, pulled suitcase and boxes off shelves. One of them found an old zither that Roy had won in a pool tournament. ‘Looky here, Joe, ’ he said, strumming it with a big paw. The cop named Joe took it and turned it over. ‘What is it?’ he asked me. ‘It’s an old zither our guinea pig used to sleep on, ’ I said. It was true that a pet guinea pig we once had would never sleep anywhere except on the zither, but I should never have said so. Joe and the other cop looked at me a long time. They put the zither back on a shelf. ‘No sign o’ nothing’ , said the cop who had first spoken to mother, ‘The lady seems hysterical. ’ They all nodded, but said nothing; just looked at me. In the small silence we all heard a creaking in the attic. Grandfather was turning over in bed. ‘What’s that?’ snapped Joe. Five or six cops sprang for the attic door before I could intervene or explain.  I realized that it would be bad if they burst in on grandfather unannounced, or even announced. He was going through a phase in which he believed that General Meade’s men, under steady hammering by Stonewall Jackson, were beginning to retreat and even desert.When I got to the attic, things were pretty confused. Grandfather had evidently jumped to the conclusion that the police were deserters from Meade’s army, trying to hide away in his attic. He bounded out of bed wearing a long flannel 10th English_Unit_2.indd32 28-11-202218:19:37www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 33nightgown over long woolen pants, a nightcap, and a leather jacket around his chest. The cops must have realized at once that the indignant white-haired old man belonged to the house, but they had no chance to say so. ‘Back, ye cowardly dog!’ roared grandfather. ‘Back t’ the lines ye goodaam Lily-livered cattle!’ With that, he fetched the officer who found the zither a flat – handed smack alongside his head that sent him sprawling. The others beat a retreat, but not enough; grandfather grabbed zither’s gun from its holster and let fly. The report seemed to crack the rafters; smoke filled the attic. A cop cursed and shot his hand to his shoulder. Somehow, we all finally got downstairs again and locked the door against the old gentleman. He fired once or twice more in the darkness and then went back to bed. ‘That was grandfather’ , I explained to Joe, out of breath. ‘He thinks you’re deserter. ’ ‘I’ll say he does, ’ said Joe.The cops were reluctant to leave without getting their hand on somebody besides grandfather; the night had been distinctly a defeat for them. Furthermore, they obviously didn’t like the ‘layout’; something looked – and I can see their viewpoint – phony. They began to poke into things again. A reporter, a thin-faced, wispy man, came up to me. I had put on one of mother’s dress, not being able to find anything else. The reporter looked at me with mingled suspicion and interest. ‘Just what the hell is the real lowdown here, Bud?’ he asked. I decided to be frank g.  What was the grandfather wearing?h.  What conclusions did grandfather jump to when he saw the cops?with him. ‘We had ghosts, ’ I said. He gazed at me a long time as if I were a slot  machine into which he had, without results, dropped a coin. Then he walked away. The cops followed him, the one grandfather shot holding his now-bandaged arm, cursing and blaspheming. ‘I’m gonna get my gun back from that old bird, ’ said the zither-cop. ‘Y eh, ’ said Joe, ‘Y ou – and who else?’ I told them I would bring it to the station house the next day.‘What was the matter with that one policeman?’ mother asked, after they had gone. ‘Grandfather shot him, ’ I said. ‘What for?’ she demanded. I told her he was a deserter. ‘Of all things!’ said mother. ‘He was such a nice-looking young man’ .Grandfather was fresh as a daisy and full of jokes at breakfast next morning. We thought at first he had forgotten all about what had happened, but he hadn’t. Over his third cup of coffee, he glared at Herman and me. ‘What was the idea of all the cops tarryhootin’ around the house last night?’ he demanded. 'None of you bothered to leave a bottle of water beside my bed. Do you ever realize what it cost for a thirsty man to look for water in the dining room last night?', he complained. He had us there.10th English_Unit_2.indd33 28-11-202218:19:37www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

His birth name was Charles Spencer Chaplin, though he had many nicknames growing up such as Charlie, Charlot, and The Little Tramp.  His father, Charles Chaplin, and his mother, Hannah Chaplin, were inducted into the music hall of fame, leading the way to his exposure even as a young boy.  His first onstage moment was when he was 5 years old; he sang a song that was intended to be sung by his own mother; she had become ill at the *Listening text is on page 21310th English_Unit_2.indd36 28-11-202218:19:37www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

He was brought to New Y ork, which was known to be a great place to start out for anyone trying to become a professional actor.  Two years later, in 1913, Chaplin signed his very first contract at Keystone and it was no time before he headed to Hollywood.  His first movie premiered in 1914, “Making a Living, ” and went on to make over 35 movies total in that year alone.  Charlie Chaplin grew to become one of the most popular and successful actors of all time.  The moment that really kicked off his long career was in 1921 when he starred in, and produced, his first full length film called “The Kid. ”  From then on, most people all over the world knew Charlie Chaplin and loved his movies.  He had a great career and life, dying on December 25, 1977, in Vevey, Switzerland.  He had apparently died of natural causes in his sleep from old age.Read the following incident carefully to answer the questions that followThe Tie that does not Bind“Oh, so you’re going abroad? Can you bring me back…..?” I’ve been asked to bring back a vaccine for a course. Once I searched the suburbs of Paris for two days for a special brand of ceramic paint. Having spent a lot of money for Cartier lighter refills, I had them confiscated at the airport just before boarding because the gas might be dangerous in the air.Now, two months before a trip, I stop talking to people so they won’t suspect I’m about to travel. But someone always catches me. ” I’ve heard you’re going to New Y ork, and I want you to get something for me. It’s just a little thing you can find anywhere. I don’t know exactly how much it costs, but it shouldn’t be much. We’ll settle up when you get back” .What Gilson asked me to buy was, in fact a little thing: a tie. But not just any tie. He wanted a tie with a small embroidered  G. Any colour would do, as long as it had his initial. Look , this is a special flight, I explained . We are only staying Saturday through Tuesday. On the day we arrived I didn’t have time to think about the tie, but strolling around on Sunday I did see 10th English_Unit_2.indd37 28-11-202218:19:38www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

Then it was Tuesday morning, time to leave. It was only when I saw our airport bus waiting outside the hotel that I remembered the tie.I told the group to go on. I would get a taxi to the airport. And so I went in search of a nearby shop where I had seen ties.But I couldn’t find it. I walked further down the street-one, two, three blocks - all in vain. Back at the hotel, a bit anxious now, I took my suitcase, got a taxi and asked the driver to rush to the street where I had seen them.The driver stopped at each shop we passed so I could look from the window. The stores had all sorts of ties, but not the kind I was looking for.When I finally thought I had located the right shop, I decided to go in and check. The driver refused to wait. Parking was prohibited, he said. I promised to double the fare, jumped out and ran into the shop. Was I going to miss the plane just for a damned tie?The salesman was unbearably slow. When I realized that the smallest change I had was a ten dollar note , I grabbed ten ties of different colours so I wouldn’t have to wait for change. I rushed out with the ties in a paper bag.On the street I looked around. The taxi had vanished, taking my suitcase. What is more, I was going to  miss the plane.I ran to the corner, and hope flared up again: the taxi was waiting in the next street. Quick to the airport! As I settled down inside the taxi. I sighed with relief. Gilson was going to have enough initialized ties to last him a lifetime.When I reached the airport, I paid the taxi driver the double fare and grabbed my suitcase. Panting, I boarded the plane under the reproachful gaze of the other passengers, all primly seated with their seat belts fastened. Ready to take off. Departure had been delayed because of me.“ At least I hope you found your tie” , said one who knew the story.“I did” , I answered triumphantly.After making myself comfortable, I reached for the paper bag to show the ties.  I had left it behind; in the taxi.  Fernando Sabino.H.  Read the incident again and answer the following questions.1.  What was the writer always asked to do whenever he planned to go abroad?2.

How to Write a Good Speech1.  Have an inspiring OPENING and ENDING. 2.  Appropriate(suitable)TONE of VOICE. (e.g.) sincere for a serious issue, humour for comedy etc3.  Adapt speech for PURPOSE and AUDIENCE. (e.g.) teenagers, mixed audience, teachers, children etc4.  Organise IDEAS logically and do not confuse the audience.5.  Use EMOTIVE language to CONVINCE your audience that what you are saying should be listened to. (e.g.) Even if they put us in chains, torture us and leave us to bleed we will not move. Blood will be our victory!6.  Use RHETORICAL QUESTIONS – asking a question for persuasive effect with out expecting a reply (because the answer is obvious) Eg: Was he not a good man? (knowing that the audience agree anyway)7.  Make sure you are writing in the CORRECT PERSON(e.g.) I believe that … I knew him well …8.  Use interesting facts and figures (e.g.)  200000 people… with diagrams or charts to help your audience  visualize it.10th English_Unit_2.indd39 28-11-202218:19:38www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

Montgomery went on to publish 20 novels as well as 530 short stories, 500 poems, and 30 essays. A prolific writer, Montgomery published over 100 stories between 1897 and 1907. Montgomery's work, diaries and letters have been read and studied by scholars and readers worldwide.The worst thing is that if anyone stays  Among them too long, he will learn their ways;  And before he dreams of the terrible jumble  He's adopted into the family of Grumble.And so it were wisest to keep our feet  From wandering into Complaining Street;  And never to growl, whatever we do,  Lest we be mistaken for Grumblers, too.Let us learn to walk with a smile and a song,  No matter if things do sometimes go wrong;  And then, be our station high or humble,  We'll never belong to the family of Grumble!4610th English_Unit_2.indd46 28-11-202218:19:39www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

Read on the story to find out there is a turn of events when they get to know the reality Dr. Ashok T. Krishnan’s clinic usually sounded more like an ancient Chinese torture chamber than a child specialist’s clinic. This was because the tiny children who were his patients left out a variety of blood –curdling yells and ear-splitting sobs.‘It’s all because my patients were making so much noise and crying so loudly, ‘ he apologized to his wife one evening, ‘that  Somu couldn’t hear me properly. He rang me in the clinic to ask whether we could keep Zigzag with us when he leaves for Alaska. And now Somu thinks I said “yes” , even though I clearly said “no” ! I know you are busy getting your painting ready for your exhibition next w… ’‘Zigzag!’ interrupted their nine-year-old daughter Maya. ‘Isn’t that Uncle Somu’s prized giant green-and-gold fighting beetle, the one that spits deadly poison straight into its opponent’s eye?’‘No , no, ’ corrected her older brother Arvind, eyes shining in pure delight. ‘The  beetle is called Spitfire. Zigzag must be Uncle Somu’s pet snake. The African sidewinder! Y ou know, the one that slithers Zigzag all over his house!’‘Y ou’re both quite mistaken, ’ their father hastened to explain, seeing his wife’s horrified expression. ‘Zigzag is a most harmless, unusual and lovable bird. Apparently, it was bred by a genuine African witch doctor, who gifted it to Somu when he-------being a child specialist like me -----------cured the witch doctor’s son while he was touring the deepest jungles of equatorial Africa last month. Somu  says the bird is an absolute treasure and a real help. It’s his favourite pet, you know’ .Somu might be your best friend, but most of these so called “favourite” possessions that he has given us were absolute nuisances!’ countered Mrs.Krishnan angrily. A talented artist, she applied  a dab of yellow-ochre paint onto her painting titled Sunset at Marina, paused for a moment to survey the effect and then continued, ‘Remember the rare insect-eating plant he brought back from the wettest corner of the Amazonian rainforest! He insisted that we keep it because it would eat the mosquitoes in the house and now that wretched plant requires a room heater to keep it alive in Chennai!’‘Ma!’ protested Arvind, ‘That’s not really true. Uncle Somu’s given us some really fabulous gifts. ’10th English_Unit_2.indd50 28-11-202218:19:41www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

That’s been really useful, ’ Maya joined the protest.‘No one but you, Maya, ’ Mrs.Krishnan told her daughter sternly,‘would describe a penknife that has cut open the pockets of three skirts and two pairs of jeans as really useful .’  ‘ And what about the aboriginal  boomerang Uncle Somu brought us all the way from Australia?’ demanded Arvind. ‘Y ou can’t deny that it was a great hit with everyone. ’‘Great hit indeed!’ Mrs.Krishnan didn’t bother to hide her sarcasm  and continued, ‘Considering that the boomerang sliced through all the TV aerials in the neighbourhood, caused permanent damage to several cars in the parking lot, and knocked out our watchman cold, with the force you threw i t .’‘But Zigzag is different. Somu says we are sure to love Zigzag, ’ soothed Dr.Krishnan, ‘because the bird can talk and sing in about twenty-one different languages - mostly African languages, of course. When it sings, it moves the listeners to tears. ’‘It’s Somu’s thoughtless ways that reduce me to tears!’ Mrs.Krishnan said irritably. ‘What a time to dump this multilingual, talking-singing bird on us. Here I’m tied up in knots trying to get my paintings together for the exhibition next w e e k .’‘May I take Zigzag to school, Papa?’ Arvind, as always, was planning ahead. ‘I want to display him in the science exhibition. ’ ‘When is Zigzag coming, Papa?’ Maya was jumping up and down, all excited.‘Uncle Somu said he would send Zigzag with his old cook, Visu, sometime today. I’ll have to leave for my clinic now. There, ’ he added as the doorbell rang, ‘that’s probably them!’ And indeed it was!‘Come in, Zigzag, come in, dear!’ coaxedVisu, and in tottered the strangest, weirdest-looking bird the Krishnan family had ever seen.About a foot and a half tall, its bald head was fringed  with a crown of shocking pink feathers while the rest of its plumage  was in various shades of the muddiest sludgiest brown. Its curved beak was sunflower-yellow and its eyes were the colour of cola held to sunlight.‘This is Zigzag! Announced Visu with a flourish. ‘His full name is Ziggy-Zagga-king-of-the-Tonga. How I’m going to miss him! So beautifully he talks! He can even recite French Poetry!’The object of all this praise was standing cool and unmoved, with an expression of almost-human grumpiness  in his cola-coloured eyes.Arvind, finding that Zigzag was sulkily refusing to say a word despite all 10th English_Unit_2.indd51 28-11-202218:19:41www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 52their efforts at striking a conversation, dashed into the kitchen to return with a plate heaped hurriedly with juicy fruit slices and some nuts.Bored eyes brightened momentarily as Zigzag picked up a walnut. But refusing to speak, he dropped one wrinkled eyelid in a solemn wink and flew clumsily to deposit the nut on the enormous chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Bit by bit, and in total silence, all the fruit on the plate was transferred to the chandelier and on to the blades of the ceiling fan (now switched off).Then perching comfortably on a curtain rod, Zigzag dropped one wizened eyelid in another solemn wink as he sank his beak into a plump guava.‘Don’t worry, children, ’ Visu comforted as he left, noticing how disappointed they looked when Zigzag stubbornly refused to say a single word to them even though they tried speaking to him in English, Hindi, Tamil and French. ‘Just wait till Zigzag settles down in this new home, they you can have a great time listening to him. ’As it happened, the children didn’t have to wait more than ten minutes to have a great time listening to Zigzag. For as soon as Visu left, Zigzag, still perched on the curtain rod, went off to sleep. And the moment he fell asleep, he began to SNORE!And what a snore it was Kngrrwheeze!!! It began as a soft grumbly sort of rumble, much like that which the stomach of a mildly hungry dinosaur might have made. Then it grew louder, and louder, and LOUDER until it sounded as if a herd of elephants with cold was trumpeting angrily in the room. KNGRRDRRWHEEZE!!!Zigzag’s snore pounded their eardrums till their heads ached.In vain did they try to wake the snoring bird. ‘Twenty-one languages, he’s supposed to know!’ snorted Mrs.Krishnan. ‘Y et this bird chooses to communicate only in snorish, snorese, snorian, snorihili, snoralu… ’‘I thought it was scientific fact that birds couldn’t snore, ’ said Maya, trying to squirt water from a small water pistol at Zigzag to wake him and wetting most of the curtains, the walls and a sofa instead.‘ African witch doctor’s birds don’t obey scientific rules. ’ Arvind was annoyed that his best imitations of a raging lion, a hungry hyena and a ferocious dog had failed to draw Zigzag out of his deep slumber. Now he tried his loudest, most frightening coyote  call.But Zigzag slept on undisturbed. And snored on.In total despair at their failure to wake Zigzag, or at least stop him snoring, they shut themselves in the bedroom that was furthest away from Mrs.Krishnan’s studio where Zigzag was creating the terrible din. Mrs.Krishnan was just unraveling a roll of cotton wool to stuff in her ears, when they heard their maid, 10th English_Unit_2.indd52 28-11-202218:19:41www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 53Lakshmi, shrieking as if she had been electrocuted.Hearts hammering, they rushed to the studio to find Lakshmi dancing and clapping her hands excitedly as she yelled, ‘We’ ve been blessed! We’ve been truly blessed! It’s raining papayas and bananas in this room!’They froze in horror. Lakshmi had apparently switched on the fan on which Zigzag had left  some fruit and nuts. Half-pecked fruit streamed off the fan, dampening even Lakshmi’s enthusiasm as a guava landed  on her cheek with a soft squish and one walnut hit her forehead with a loud smack. One slice of over-ripe papaya came whizzing off the fan and, as they watched it helplessly, it oh  horrors splattered all over Mrs.Krishnan’s unfinished masterpiece, sunset at Marina, spreading streaks of gooey orange pulp and shiny black seeds all over it.Mrs.Krishnan groaned tragically and looked ready to shoot Zigzag, but he was saved by the bell. The telephone bell! They answered one call after another as all the neighbours rang upto demand what the awful KNGRRDRRWHEEZE sound was and if they could please have some peace.And through all this commotion, Zigzag slept on unconcerned. And snored on.Finally, an exhausted Mrs.Krishnan rang up her husband. I’am going crazy with the sound of Zigzag snoring, plus all these angry telephone calls. And my beautiful painting… ’ Here her voice cracked. ‘Y ou know Mrs.Jhunjhunwala, the art critic who lives upstairs, well, she heard Zigzag snoring and had the cheek to telephone and ask me whether I could sing a little softly when I took my singing lessons. Please contact Somu and find out what we should do. ’Dr.Krishnan came home as fast as he could after he had left an e-mail message for Somu, asking him for clear instructions on how to stop Zigzag from snoring. ’‘Don’t worry, ’ he reassured his downcast family. ‘Somu will reply soon and we’ll discover there’s some ridiculously simple way to stop Zigzag from snoring.Six days passed. Six frantic days of checking their e-mail day and night. Six torturous days of having the deafeningly loud KNGRRDRRWHEEZE resound in their home, most nerve wrackingly. Maya complained that she heard a permanent rumbling sound in her ears even when she was miles away from home and that her ears ached all the time. Arvind confessed that, for the first time in his life, he was actually looking forward to going to school considering it was as calm as a monastery compared to their house. Mrs.Krishnan had lost interest in painting. 10th English_Unit_2.indd53 28-11-202218:19:41www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 54Zigzag would sometimes wake up briefly when he wanted to eat some fruit, and sometimes he would sit on the veranda looking sulky and bored as he stared at the Sunset at Marina beach- the real view, not the painting lying forlorn in one corner, ruined by streaks  of hardening papaya. Zigzag never spoke to anyone, though everyone tried several times, and in several languages, to speak to him kindly. He only slept. And snored.On the seventh day, Dr.Somu’s e-mail arrived. It was, as Dr.Krishnan predicted, ridiculously simple. It read:Love ,Somu.P .S. If you’ re /f_inding it diﬃcult, ask my cook Visu to keep Zigzag.I’ve never heard Zigzag snore. In fact, Zigzag hardly ever sleeps.‘That does it, ’ said Mrs.Krishnan. ‘Find Visu! I will not keep Zigzag here another minute!’‘Calm down, dear, I’m leaving for my clinic now. Can’t it wait till… ’‘No, it’s now!’ Mrs.Krishnan was adamant. ‘I’ve invited some friends and are experts to come home and choose my paintings for the exhibition. This feathered, snoring monster will drive us all mad!’‘Come on then, Zigzag, ’ called Dr.Krishnan nervously, wondering how he would locate Somu’s cook, Visu.‘Er, why don’t you wait in the car, Zigzag?’ he suggested. When they reached his clinic, his heart sinking at the thought of Zigzag’s ear-shatteringly loud snore adding to the din of the sobs and shrieks produced by the tiny patients waiting for him.But Ziggy-Zagga-King-of-the-Tonga was not accustomed to being kept waiting and was already making his way to the clinic where he perched himself on the nurse’s reception table.‘Don’t you dare sleep!’ Dr.Krishnan warned Zigzag fiercely as he went towards his room.He had hardly walked through the swinging half-door that separated his clinic from the waiting room when he heard a strange voice say, ‘Y ou there in the blue T-shirt, don’t jump on the sofa. And you in the red dress, don’t swing on the curtain. ’It was Zigzag’s voice, clear and commanding. There was pin-drop silence in the room as everyone waited, open-mouthed, for Zigzag’s next sentence.Dr.Krishnan was amazed! Gone was Zigzag’s bored and grumpy expression. Instead the bird looked happy and alert as it went about the job it had been trained for, first with the African witch doctor and then with Dr.Somu. Dr.Krishnan’s clinic, usually a noisy sea of tears and tantrums, was transformed into a calm, orderly 10th English_Unit_2.indd54 28-11-202218:19:42www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 55place as Zigzag efficiently soothed the frightened patients, scolded the naughty ones and made the crying ones smile. And if his yam-digging song and recitation of French poetry reduced the children to helpless laughter instead of tears, he didn’t look as though he minded. And best of all, Zigzag never slept. Or snored. Even for a second!Never had a morning passed so quietly and peacefully for Dr.Krishnan. When the last patient had left, he called Zigzag to his room. Zigzag flew in and sat on the table. Scratching the bird under its beak, Dr.Krishnan sighed and said, ‘Somu was right, after all. Y ou are an absolute treasure. I never realized what he meant when he called you a great help. Why didn’t you tell me you’ d prefer to be at my clinic instead of snoring like that to show you were bored? What do we do now? No one wants you back at home now; they want me to leave you with Visu. ’Just then the telephone rang. It was Mrs. Krishnan, sounding very pleased with herself. ‘Y ou know Mrs.Jhunjhunwala, the art critic?’ she chuckled. ‘She doesn’t want me to exhibit Sunset at Marina. She’s bought it for herself, for ₹ 5,000!’Isn’t that the painting the papaya fell on …..? ‘Y es. ’ Mrs.Krishnan was laughing heartily now. I had left it in one corner and she chose to buy it, saying she loved my new technique of painting! She simply adored those streaky orangey bits! She launched into fresh gales of laughter. ‘By the way, ’ she said when she sobered down, ‘I don’t think we were fair to Zigzag. Shall we keep him with us at home, just on trial for another week?’‘Sure!’ , agreed a delighted Dr.Krishnan before he cleverly added. ‘ And I could always take him to the clinic every morning so that you can paint in peace at home. ’‘My boy!’ he confided to Zigzag after matters were satisfactorily settled, giving the bird a toffee from his desk. ‘Y ou have your own strange way of showing your genius. A Zigzag way, I’ d call it, wouldn’t you?’But Ziggy - Zagga - King - of - the -Tonga, brought up on compliments as he was, didn’t bother to reply. He just ate the toffee, paper wrapper and all, and then lowered one crinkly eyelid in a knowing wink.About the authorAsha Nehemiah born in 1958 at Chennai has lived, studied and worked in 8 different cities and small towns and is now a resident of Bangalore.

              " 60Gone are the days, where women in India remained indoors unless permitted to go out with an escort. Conditions today have changed, thanks to all those women who have fought for their freedom and set a very good example for others. The real power of women though realised earlier, is currently being projected to the world by the advancement of technology and media. Women occupy almost all the major positions in society. Currently, women’s accomplishments are tremendous in many fields. One such achievement is the All-women Indian Navy crew who circumnavigated the world for 254 days all alone, in a sailboat called INSV Tarini. What is INSV Tarini?INSV stands for Indian Naval Ship Vessel. Tara-Tarini is the patron deity for sailors and is worshipped for safety and success at sea.INSV Tarini is the second sailboat of the Indian Navy (The first being the INSV Mhadei). It is a 55 foot sailing vessel built indigenously in India by M/s Aquarius Shipyard Pvt. Ltd, located in Goa. After undergoing extensive sea trials, she was commissioned to the Indian Navy service on 18 February 2017. The boat was named after the famous ‘Tara-Tarini’ temple in Ganjam district of Odisha. The word ‘Tarini’ means ‘boat’ and in Sanskrit it means ‘Saviour’ . INSV Tarini has an advanced Raymarine navigation suite and an array of satellite communication systems for perfect navigation anywhere in world.Navika Sagar Parikrama was a project undertaken in consonance  with the National policy to empower women to attain their full potential. “The Project is considered essential towards promoting ocean sailing activities in the Navy while depicting Government of India’s thrust for Nari Shakti (women power), ” said Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sunil Lanba in his welcome speech.The voyage was aimed to showcase ‘Make in India’ initiative by sailing on-board indigenously built INSV Tarini. The special feature of this sailboat was  that it encouraged the use of environment friendly non-conventional renewable  energy resources such as the wind; collected and updated meteorological, ocean and wave data on regular basis for accurate weather forecast by India Meteorological Department (IMD) and also collected data for monitoring marine pollution on high seas.a.

              " 61Indian Navy’s Six Women CrewIndian Navy’s all-women crew was the first-ever to circumnavigate the globe skippered  by Lt. Cdr. Vartika Joshi. The all-women team has also Lt. Cdr. Pratibh Jamwal, Lt. Cdr. Swathi Patarapalli, Lt. Aishwarya Boddapati, Lt. Vijaya Devi and Lt. Payal Gupta as its crew members.  The crew started their voyage on 10 September 2017 from Goa, flagged off by the Defence Minister of India.  It was a historic day, which would be marked in navigation history and globally. It covered the expedition in five legs with stop-overs at four ports (Fremantle, Australia; Lyttleton, New Zealand; Port Stanley, the Falklands and Cape Town, South Africa) for replenishment of ration and repair as necessary, before returning to Goa in April 2018. They went around the globe within 254-days and reached Goa port on 21 May 2018. The six member women crew broke many stereotypes during their record-setting sail.An Interview with the crew membersIndia’s all-women navy crew who went around the world in 254-days have shared their experiences about their great voyage in an interview. Through their personal experiences, we really come to know their hardships and unpredictable challenges they have faced all through their expeditions.Interviewer:  How well were you acquainted with the sail boat before you took up the task?Vartika Joshi: None of us was acquainted with a sail boat or ocean-going boat; none of us had sailed before, nor are woman officers allowed entry in combat platforms as yet. At first, it was difficult to take the boat out to sea, from one point to another. But we slowly built upon it through three years of training.The first Indian solo circumnavigation was undertaken by Capt. Dilip Donde,  (Retd.) from August 19, 2009 to May 19, 2010 on board another India-built vessel INSV Mhadei. The first Indian non-stop solo circumnavigation was undertaken by Cdr. Abhilash Tomy,  from November 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013.10th English_Unit_3.indd61 28-11-202218:20:27www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 62 Interviewer:  Ca n you tell us about the training you had undergone before this expedition? Vartika Joshi: We started with some theoretical courses on navigation, communication and weather prediction. Classroom courses are different from sailing outside. So, we were given hands-on training, like, how to repair things and how to deal with emergencies, when the weather gets rough, if there is a medical emergency, and training was needed in tactical aspects as well.Aishwarya: We underwent our basic sail training courses in Mumbai at the Indian Naval Waterman ship Training Centre (INWTC), and at various schools in the southern naval base in Kochi. We even sailed on INSV Mhadei to Mauritius (in 2016 and 2017) and back and also to Cape Town in December 2016. We were trained for almost three years to prepare for the voyage. Since the boat was old, it had minor leaks and repairs. Also, we ran out of water and food soon. So the trip was a tutorial for us on how to manage food, water and even electricity during the big voyage.Interviewer:  What was the selection process? Aishwarya: Out of the thirty women who had applied, six of us were shortlisted, based on the little survival skills we showcased. The crew was mentored by Commander Dilip Donde. But after I was told about the flare-ups at sea, I even had second thoughts about joining the team.Interviewer:  How did your family members react when you told them about this expedition?  Vartika Joshi: Our families did have a hard time, but that was because most of them had never even seen the sea! Four of us are from the mountains. The first time my parents saw the ocean was when I invited them to visit. But once they saw that we’re doing well and looking after ourselves, they were quite supportive. They were apprehensive  and supportive too.10th English_Unit_3.indd62 28-11-202218:20:29www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 63Interviewer:  What were your aims and how did you work to achieve them? Vartika Joshi: I wanted to make sure that I complete this journey with ultimate honesty. I didn’t set out for a destination; it was the journey that mattered to me the most. So my contention was to make sure that we go by the rules of circumnavigation which say that you don’t have to use any auxiliary means of repulsion and you don’t have to take anybody else’s assistance. I grasped that completely. Interviewer:  Name that one quality of yours that enabled you to complete this expedition successfully? Vartika Joshi: Whenever the winds dropped, it wouldn’t have taken me even a fraction of second to switch on the engine and say let’s go one mile ahead. But inside of me something poked me and said that you have to be honest with yourself and this expedition has to be done with honesty. I am glad that we were able to finish it successfully without the use of  the engine at all.Interviewer:  As the head of the crew, how did you involve the team?Vartika Joshi: We’ve all sailed and trained the same amount, and everybody has their own way of dealing with situations, but that was a good thing, d.  Where did the crew undergo their basic training?e.  How long were they trained to undertake this voyage?f.  Which skill was considered important in the selection process?g.  Who mentored the crew? because we could discuss different ways of solving a problem and choose the best one. In fact, I’ d say it was easier for us to collaborate and work together.Payal Gupta: When you are out at sea, teamwork is the most important in the middle of the crisis. Even during the storm when three people would be out on watch, the other three who would be inside wouldn’t be able to rest. Somebody would heat the water, the other person would heat the gloves because it was raining also. So team effort actually helped in navigating through the 20 hours long storm. I feel that if I had been alone then it would have been a nightmare to deal with the challenges that the sea throws at you.Interviewer:  Share your experience about the most challenging task while sailing.Vartika Joshi: The Sea can get really tough when winds are picking up. Those are the times we have to be active and need to anticipate  what could be there ahead. In the South Pacific, we encountered a storm where the seas were almost nine to ten meters high and the winds were picking up to 60–70 knots(a unit of speed equal to one nautical mile per hour exactly 1.852km/h), which is about a hurricane force of wind on land. It is normal on sea where there is hardly any land mass to stop the winds.It was also a blissful experience when something broke down and after a lot of hard work and effort, we were able to fix it together. We will remember these incidents as well because they gave us the strength to move on and if something went bad, we were able to overcome those challenges. 10th English_Unit_3.indd63 28-11-202218:20:29www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 64Interviewer:  What were the exciting moments during the trip?Vartika Joshi: When we were crossing the Tasman Sea, we witnessed the brilliant Southern Lights from sea. It was rare to watch that in those months, that too from sea. We were absolutely awestruck  as we were not expecting it, to see the entire sky lit up in green light. There was bio-luminescence , dolphins swimming in the wake of the boat like our neighbours and a variety of sea creatures. We spotted a dead sperm whale once and we thought it was an island from a distance, it was so huge. We are not specialists, so whenever we spotted something in the sea, we had to Google it to learn more about the species.Interviewer: How did your crew spend time deep in the sea?Swathi P: During circumnavigation, we picked up some hobbies and kept posting pictures of delicacies like golgappas  and cakes. We also read books when the weather was pleasant and did some quilling and craft work. While team leader Joshi read comics and the Ramayana during her journey, I loved cooking as well so I indulged in baking. I also liked crafting a lot, so I used to make lampshades. I love it when people appreciate the food that I cook, so I gave my crew members the best dishes that was possible on land with the limited resources that we had on the boat.Vartika Joshi: Six is a great number, we were always entertained. We watched movies, listened to music, and you won’t believe some of the goodies the crew rustled up in our tiny pantry, even while sailing in rough seas. We made parathas, baked cakes and breads, and even made halwa and rasgullas!We celebrated festivals at sea. When we think about it now on land, we remember the Diwali we spent at sea. We celebrated three birthdays including the first birthday of the boat; also specific occasions like crossing the equator, the International Date Line and such. Interviewer:  What motivated you to fulfil the country’s expectations?  Swathi P: We knew that the entire country was watching us and praying for us, so we never wanted them to have a single day thinking that we are in trouble. We knew that it is going to happen but the people out there did not know what kind of challenges we were facing. So, one of the motives that we kept in mind was that we did not want to frighten them. We decided that once the circumnavigating was over, we are going to show what we have actually gone through.Interviewer:  As a woman, how would you consider this expedition?Vartika Joshi: It is a matter of great honour and we couldn’t have imagined anything better for our cast-off. Of course we being an all-woman team, it is a great boost to women in the country. But, as we are going as sailors, and we as sailors have seen that the sea does not discriminate between genders. It is always gender-neutral and we have realised that gender does not play a role in sailing. But to boost the morale in the country and for more women to take in adventures like sailing, I feel it is great that an all-woman team had been formed to undergo this expedition.10th English_Unit_3.indd64 28-11-202218:20:29www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

The meaning of the word  is not literal. For example, if one says that  the cat is out of the bag then it does not literally mean the cat is out of the bag but it has a figurative meaning which means the secret is out.  That’s why the meaning of idioms cannot be assumed based on the individual meaning of the words but by studying the words as a unit.Examples1.  Lalitha takes a late night walk in the beach once in a blue moon.In the above sentence ‘once in a blue moon’ is an idiom which means an event that happens rarely. 2.  The women cricketers were on the ball  in their last over of the match. In the above sentence ‘on the ball’  is an idiom which means when someone understands the situations well.A Phrase, on the other hand, is a small group of words put together as a conceptual unit. It does not take a figurative meaning. The meaning of the word is literal . It can be long or short but it does not include the subject-verb pairing, necessary to make a clause. For example, ‘ looking stunning’; to live and breathe’; ‘comfortable bed’ .10th English_Unit_3.indd66 28-11-202218:20:29www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

              " 88This is the classic story of Mulan based on the legend of Hua Mulan. A  legend is a story from long ago that is believed to be true, or mostly true. Many years ago, China was in the middle of a great war.  The Emperor said that one man from each Chinese family must leave his family to join the army. Mulan, a teenage girl who lived in a faraway village of China, heard the news when she was outside, washing clothes. Mulan ran into the house.  Her father was sitting in a chair, carving  a piece of wood. “Father!” she said. “Did you hear what the Emperor says each family must do?” “Y es, ” said her old father, “I heard about it in town.  Well, I may as well go pack up. ”  He put down his carving, stood up and walked very slowly to his room.  Supplementary 3The Story of Mulan“Wait!” said Mulan, “Father, you have not been well.  If I may say so, why at your age must you keep up with all those young men?”“What else can be done?” said her father.  “Y our brother is a child.  He cannot g o.”“Of course that's true, ” said Mulan. “He is too little.  But I have an idea. ” She poured her father a cup of tea and handed it to him. “Father, have some tea. Please sit for a minute. I will be right back. ” \"Very well, dear,\" said the father.Mulan went into her room. With her sword, she cut off her long, black hair. She put on her father’s robe .  Going back to her father, Mulan said, “Look at me.  I am your son now.  I will go in your place.  I will do my part for China. ” “No, my daughter!” said the old man. “Y ou cannot do this!”10th English_Unit_3.indd88 28-11-202218:20:38www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 89“Father, listen please,\" said Mulan.  “For years, you trained me in Kung Fu .  Y ou showed me how to use a sword. ”  Mulan swung the sword back and forth with might.“Only so that you could stay safe!” said her father.  “I never meant for you to go to war.  If they find out you are a woman, you know as well as I do that you will die!”“No one will find out, Father, ” said Mulan.  She picked up her sword.\"Mulan!\" said the Father.  He tried to get up but had to hold on to his chair.  The daughter kissed him goodbye.  \"I love you, Father,\" she said.  \"Take care of yourself.  Tell my brother I said goodbye.\" She climbed on a family horse.  And off she went to join the Emperor’s army.In the army, Mulan proved to be a brave soldier.  In time, she was put in charge of other soldiers.  Her battles went so well that she was put in charge of more soldiers.  Her battles kept on going well.  After a few years Mulan was given the top job – she would be General of the entire army.  Not long after that, a very bad fever swept through the army.  Many soldiers were sick.  And Mulan, the General of the army, became sick, too.  When the doctor came out of Mulan's tent, he knew the truth.“The General is a woman?” yelled the soldiers.  “How can this be?”  Some called out, “She tricked us!” and “We will not fight for a woman!” They said, “Punish her!  Make her pay!  The cost is for her to die!” But others called out, in voices just as loud, “With Mulan, we win every battle!”  They said, “Stay away from our General!”Just then, a soldier ran up.  “Everyone!\" he called.  \"A surprise attack is coming!”Mulan heard this from inside her tent.  She got dressed and went outside.  She was not yet strong, but stood tall.  She told the soldiers where they must go to hide so they could attack when the enemy came.  But they must get there fast!  The soldiers, even those who did not like that their General was a woman, could tell that Mulan knew what she was talking about. It worked! The battle was won.  It was such a big victory that the enemy gave up, at last. The war was over, and China was saved! Y ou can be sure that after that last battle, no one cared anymore that Mulan was a woman.The Emperor was so glad that Mulan had ended the long war, he set aside the rule about being a woman.  “Mulan, stay with me in the palace, ” he said. “Someone as smart as you would be a fine royal adviser. ”  Mulan bowed  deeply.  “Y ou are too kind, Sire, ” she said.  “But if you please,  what I wish most of all is to return home to my family. ”“Then at least take these fine gifts, ” said the Emperor. \"So everyone at your home and village will know how much the Emperor of China thinks of you. ”Mulan returned to her village with six fine horses and six fine swords. Everyone cheered that she was safe.  The person who had saved China was their very own Mulan!10th English_Unit_3.indd89 28-11-202218:20:38www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

The pioneers of this dance credit Kung Fu as one of its influences. Moves such as the crouching low leg sweep and “up rocking” (standing combat moves) are influenced by choreographed Kung Fu fights.   Many people have a misconception that Chinese Kung Fu is about fighting and killing. It is actually based on Chinese philosophy and is about improving wisdom and intelligence. Taoist philosophy is deeply rooted in and had a profound influence on the culture of Chinese martial arts.   The five traditional animal styles of Shaolin Kung Fu are the dragon, the snake, the tiger, the leopard and the crane. The union of the five animal forms clearly displayed the efficacy of both hard and soft movements, of both internal and external energy – this form of Chinese martial arts was known as Shaolin Kung Fu, named after the temple in which it was developed.   Kung Fu – ‘kung’ meaning ‘energy’ and ‘fu’ meaning ‘time’ – is a Chinese martial art whose recorded history dates back to around 525 CE, during the Liang dynasty. The man credited with introducing martial arts to China is said to be an Indian monk known as Bodhidarma.   Hua Mulan is a legendary Chinese warrior from the Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589) period of Chinese history, originally described in the Ballad of Mulan. In the ballad, Hua Mulan, disguised as a man, takes her aged father's place in the army. Mulan fought for twelve years and gained high merit, but she refused any reward and retired to her hometown.10th English_Unit_3.indd91 28-11-202218:20:38www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

              " 94Aditya and I were returning from the site of our new factory at Deodarganj. We were driving  along National Highway 40. We had reached a point where the road bifurcated . If we drove ten kilometres along the road that branched off to the right, we would reach Bramhapur. I asked Aditya whether he was interested in revisiting the place of his birth, which he had left after he had passed the matriculation examination from the local school to continue his studies in Calcutta.‘When I left our ancestral house, twenty-nine years ago, the house was almost two hundred years old, ’ recollected Aditya. ‘I doubt if even the school building, which may have undergone many changes, will be recognisable any more. Trying to revive  old childhood memories may prove disappointing!’But he said he wished to visit the tea shop of Nagen Uncle, if it still existed, and have a cup of tea there.So we took the turning to the right and decided to drive to Bramhapur, of which Aditya’s ancestors were once the zamindars.Aditya’s father had left the ancestral home and moved to Kolkata, where he had set up his own business. After his death, Aditya was looking after it, and I was his friend and business partner.It was the month of Magha, that is January – February by the English calendar – the middle of winter. By my watch, it was 3:30 in the afternoon. The sun was soothing . On either side of the road were paddy fields, as far as the eye could see. Harvest was over and there had been a good crop that year.After about ten minutes, we came to the local school. Beyond the iron gates were the playing field and the two-storeyed a.When did Aditya  leave the local school?b.  Why did Aditya think that the school would not be recognisable?Prose 4 The Attic It is natural for human beings to make mistakes. When we realise our mistakes, we should try to rectify them.

              " 95school building. We got down from the car and stood in front of the gate.I asked Aditya whether everything was still the same. He replied that everything had changed.‘Our school used to be one-storeyed, and a new building has come up, which wasn’t there. ’‘Were you not a good student?’ I asked.‘Y es, but my position was always second, ’ he replied. We decided to go and have tea at Nagen uncle’s tea shop, which stood next to a grocery shop and opposite a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Soon, we caught sight of ‘Nagen’s Tea Cabin’ written on a signboard over the shop.The owner of the tea shop, now over sixty, a little rustic  in appearance, with his white neatly-combed hair and clean look, was the same as before. He was wearing a dhoti and a blue striped shirt that could be seen from under a green shawl.Not recognising Aditya, he asked us where we had come from.‘Deodarganj, ’ Aditya replied. ‘We are on our way to Kolkata. ’A little surprised, Nagen uncle asked why we were there.‘To have tea at your shop, ’ said Aditya.‘Certainly, besides tea, I have biscuits and savouries. ’c.  Who were Aditya’s ancestors?d.  How was  the landscape through which they travelled.e.  What did Aditya visit?‘Give us two nankhatai  each. ’ .We sat on two tin chairs. There was only one other customer sitting at a corner table, neither eating nor drinking tea, but sitting with his head  bent, as though he were sleeping.Addressing him as Mr Sanyal, Nagen uncle reminded him to go home, as it was already 4 p.m. Other customers would soon be coming. Addressing us he said, with a wink in his eye, ‘ A little hard of hearing. Cannot see well either. But has no money to buy spectacles. ’From his reaction to this speech, I began to wonder whether Mr Sanyal was not a little crazy as well, because suddenly he stood up, stretched himself and, raising his lean right arm, and with eyes dilated , began to recite a poem by Tagore – Panraksha (‘Keeping of a Promise’). Having recited the poem, he left the place, making the gesture of Namaste with his hands, to nobody in particular.f. Where was Nagen uncle’s shop?g.  Besides tea, what did Nagen uncle have in his shop?10th English_Unit_4.indd95 28-11-202218:21:45www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 96I noticed a sudden change in Aditya’s expression and I asked him the reason for it. Without answering me, he asked Nagen uncle who the gentleman was and what he did.Nagen uncle replied, ‘Sasanka Sanyal. What can be done? He leads a cursed life – gone crazy, I think, but has not forgotten any incident of the past. Sold his lands to get his only daughter married. He lost his wife and only son last year. Since then he is somewhat changed – not really normal. ’‘Where does he stay?’‘He stays with a friend of his father’s – Jogesh Kabiraj. Sasanka comes here, has tea and biscuits and always remembers to pay – having an acute sense of self-respect. But how long things will remain like this, I don’t know’ .Having paid our bill and ascertained  the location of Jogesh Kabiraj’s house, we got into the car. Aditya was at the wheel. He expressed the wish to visit his house.‘So you do want to see your house after all?’ I said.‘It has become essential to do so, ’ Aditya replied. His nerves seemed overwrought  j.  What did Nagen uncle tell about Sanyal’s past life?k.  How did Sanyal show that he had a sense of self-respect?for some reason. We soon reached the house, which was surrounded by high walls. Even from the ruins, one could easily imagine how grand it must have been once upon a time.We entered the building, climbed up the stairs and reached the attic  on the second floor of the house.‘This was my favourite room, ’ said Aditya. The attic has always been a favourite with children. It is in the attic that the child seems to be in a world of its own.A portion of a wall of the attic had crumbled down, and through the ‘window’ that had been created, we could see the sky, the fields, a part of the rice mill, the spire  of the old temple. In the whole house, the attic had probably been the worst hit by wind and weather. The floor was strewn with twigs and straw and pigeon droppings. Among other things, there was a broken cricket bat, the remains of an armchair and a wooden packing case.Aditya got on top of the packing case and pushed his hand inside the ventilator, thus upsetting a sparrow’s nest, a part of which fell to the ground. However, he heaved a sigh of relief when he had got what he had been looking for. When I h.  What did Nagen uncle tell about Sanyal?i.

              " 97asked him what it was, he said, ‘Y ou’ll get to know very soon. ’We next went to a jeweller’s to find out the weight of the article. The jeweller remarked that it was an antique. Our next stop was the house of Jogesh Kabiraj. Though I was a little curious, I didn’t ask Aditya anything.We entered the house and went to the room where Sasanka Sanyal stayed. Sasanka uncle  was busy reciting verses from Tagore. When he had finished, Aditya asked, ‘May we come in?’He turned and faced us.‘No one visits me, ’ he said in an unperturbed manner.‘Would you mind if we come in?’‘Come in. ’Except for a charpoy  there was nothing else to sit on, so we remained standing.‘Do you remember Aditya Narayan Chowdhury?’ Aditya asked him.l.Why was the attic ‘a favourite place’ for the children?m.  What did Aditya do on reaching the attic?‘Of course, ’ said the gentleman. ‘’The spoilt child of affluent parents! Was a fairly good student but could never beat me. He was extremely jealous of me. And he used to tell lies. ’‘I know, ’ said Aditya. He then took out a packet from his pocket and handing it over to him, said, ‘This is for you, from Aditya. ’‘What is it?’ he asked.‘ M o n e y ’.‘Money? How much money?’‘One hundred and fifty rupees. He has said that he will be happy if you accept it. ’‘Shall I laugh or cry?  Aditya has given me money! Why this sudden generosity?’‘Man does change with time. Perhaps Aditya is not the same Aditya as before?’‘ A change? I got the prize. He could not bear it. He took it from me to show his father and never returned it to me. Said that there was a hole in his pocket and it had fallen through it. ’‘This is the price of the medal. It is yours. ’Sasanka Sanyal was amazed. He stared at Aditya and said, ‘The price of the medal? That could not be more than five rupees. It was a silver medal. ’ ‘Silver is now thirty times costlier than b e f o r e .’n.  What did the jeweller say about the article?o.  Was Sanyal happy about his visitors?10th English_Unit_4.indd97 28-11-202218:21:46www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 98‘Really? I had no news of that. But … ’Sasanka uncle looked at the fifteen  ten-rupee notes in his hand and then looked at Aditya. There was a completely new expression on his face. He said, ‘ Aditya, this smacks too much of charity. Doesn’t it?’We remained silent. Peering intently at Aditya, Sasanka Sanyal smiled and said, ‘I had recognised you at Nagen uncle ’s tea shop by that mole on your right cheek. I could see you had not recognised me. So I recited the same poem that I had recited on the prize-giving day, on purpose, so that you may remember. Then, when you came to visit me, I couldn’t help venting my anger on you. ’‘Y ou have done the right thing. Y our grievances are absolutely justified. But I will be happy if you accept the money, ’ said Aditya.Sasanka Sanyal shook his head and said, ‘No. Money will soon be spent. I would have preferred to have the medal if it were possible. I would have forgotten that unpleasant incident of my childhood if I could get the medal back. ’So, the medal that had been hidden in the attic for twenty-nine long years was eventually restored to its owner.‘Sriman Sasanka Sanyal – Special Prize for Recitation - 1948’ was still clearly engraved on it. (Translated from the Bengali story Chilekotha)About the Author:Satyajit Ray (1921 - 1992) was an Indian film maker, screen writer, graphic artist, music composer and author. He was born in Kolkatta. He authored several short stories and novels meant primarily for young children and teenagers.  He revived the children’s magazine ‘Sandesh’ (which his grandfather had started in 1913) and edited it until his death in 1992. Ray was more interested in writing, rather than film making.  His stories have been translated in Europe, the United States and many other countries.  Ray received many awards including 32 National Film Awards  by the Government of India, notably the Padma Bhushan in 1965 and the highest civilian honour ‘Bharat Ratna’ shortly before his death.  p.

For example,(A)  After 1885, trade with Europe grew . (Verb)(B)  After 1885, there was a growth  in trade with Europe. (Noun)In sentence B, we have used the word ‘growth’ which is the noun form of the verb ‘grow’ by adding the suffix ‘th’ .Nominalisation can be done in three different ways.1.  We can add suffixes like -ment, -tion, -sion, -ness, -ation, -ity, -al to verbs  and adjectives.Examples:admire  – admirationarrive– arrivalcareless– carelessnessfail– failureinclude– inclusionintense– intensitypunish– punishment2.  Some words are turned into nouns without any adding suffix.Examples: bleed– bloodlose– lossprove– proofsell – salespeak– speech3.

Throughout the season when he gave his best, even though it was not quite enough to gain that extra point, you recognised his contribution with a pat on the back and encouraging words.Y our wise approach showed him that, although winning is a goal, there are other goals just as worthy. He learned the value of finishing what he started and joy of personal accomplishment. These attributes carried him through a season that was full of hard work and fun, discouragement and resolve, defeat and victory.And at the very end, at the championship meet when he brought home his first place medal, you were among those who were so very proud of how far he had come. It is a victory to all of us. What amazes me is you’ve taught them skills that will last a lifetime. Y ou’ve kindled in them a desire to excel.

Pollution whether it is air, land, noise or water always has adverse effects.India is the world’s largest consumer of fuel wood, agricultural waste and biomass for energy purposes, which releases millions of tonnes of pollutants into the air every year. Vehicle emissions, another source of air pollution, get worsened by fuel adulteration and poor fuel combustion efficiencies from traffic congestion. Factories pollute air through fossil fuel emissions. These emissions include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.Air pollution is the main cause for the monsoon to be delayed. Air pollution is the major cause for several health hazards. It damages vegetation and animal life too.Steps must be taken to clean smoke stacks and exhaust pipes in factories. Vehicles must be checked periodically and maintained meticulously. We can opt  for renewable or alternative energy sources. Using such renewable and sustainable energy sources reduces pollution. Creating awareness is the remedial measure to check pollution. We as responsible citizens, must willingly contribute to the reduction of air pollution. Ecological issues are an integral part of environmental issues that challenges India. So it is high time we should take stringent steps to stop pollution that affect us.

These fables became popular when they emerged in print. Several stories are attributed to Aesop even today. The process of inclusion is continuous and new stories are being added.  Collections of Aesop’s fables were among the earliest books to be printed in many languages. Cricket is a brown or black insect related to the grasshopper but with shorter legs. It is a small insect that produces short, loud sounds by rubbing its wings together.10th English_Unit_4.indd117 28-11-202218:21:49www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

              " 120Supplementary 4The Aged MotherMatsuo BashoThis Japanese folktale is also known as ‘The Story of the Aged Mother’ .  It highlights that the aged are sharp witted.  It describes the love and affection a son and his mother have for one another.Long, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and they were humble, peaceful, and happy.The country Shining was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation . The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous  days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence , and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate  of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death.Just at sundown, when his day’s work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which was the principal food for the poor, and he cooked, dried it, and tied it in a square cloth, which he swung in a bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and started on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrow road was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they lost and confuses, but he gave no heed. One path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward -- ever upward towards the high bare summit of what is known as Obatsuyama, the mountain of the “abandoning of the aged” .The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain’s many paths and his return might be one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that as they climbed,  10th English_Unit_4.indd120 28-11-202218:21:50www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 121the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequent intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth gently released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen pine needles, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifted his old mother onto it. He wrapped her padded coat more closely about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart he said farewell.The trembling mother’s voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. “Let not thine eyes be blinded, my son. ” She said. “The mountain road is full of dangers. LOOK carefully and follow the path which holds the piles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar path farther down” . The son’s surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the poor old, shriveled  hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart broke within and bowing to the ground, he cried aloud: “Oh, honorable mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I will not leave you. Together we will follow the path of twigs, and together we will die!”Once more he shouldered his burden (how light it seemed now) and hastened down the path, through the shadows and the moonlight, to the little hut in the valley. Beneath the kitchen floor was a walled closet for food, which was covered and hidden from view. There the son hid his mother, supplying her with everything she needed, continually watching and fearing she would be discovered. Time passed, and he was beginning to feel safe when again the governor sent forth heralds bearing an unreasonable order, seemingly as a boast of his power. His demand was that his subjects should present him with a rope of ashes.The entire province trembled with dread. The order must be obeyed yet who in all Shining could make a rope of ashes? One night, in great distress, the son whispered the news to his hidden mother. “Wait!” she said. “I will think. I will think” On the second day she told him what to do. “Make rope of twisted straw, ” she said. “Then stretch it upon a row of flat stones and burn it on a windless night. ” He called the people together and did as she said and when the blaze died down, there upon the stones, with every twist and fiber showing perfectly, lay a rope of ashes.The governor was pleased at the wit of the youth and praised greatly, but he demanded to know where he had obtained his wisdom. “ Alas! Alas!” cried the farmer, “the truth must be told!” and with deep bows he related his story. The governor listened and then meditated in silence. Finally he lifted his head. “Shining needs more than strength of youth, ” he said gravely . “ Ah, that I should have forgotten the well-known saying, “with the crown of snow, there cometh wisdom!” That very hour the cruel law was abolished, and 10th English_Unit_4.indd121 28-11-202218:21:50www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

India is home to 2.7 crore people living with one or the other kind of disability. According This lesson talks about the use of technology by a normal person and in empowering the disabled to do their day to day chores of life – to travel, to communicate, to learn, to do business and to live in comfort. Alisha and David’s life has changed with the use of technology. Technology impacts the environment, people and the society as a whole. The way we use technology determines if its impacts are positive to the society or negative.to the 2011 Census, 2.21 percent of India’s population is disabled. Unlike the developed world, India’s disabled are deprived by attitudinal barriers as they continue to grapple with the challenges of access, acceptance and inclusion.Alisha says, “I would probably still have done it because I want everyone to know the difference technology has made in my life. But it would have been  frustrating and  difficult. ”“I have cerebral palsy and I can’t physically type as fast as I think or anywhere near. But right now, that’s what I’m doing.

It’s made me achieve things I only dreamt of.I used to have a teacher, she’s passed away now and one day she said to me. ‘Y ou’re going to do your Maths GCSE ( General Certificate of Secondary Education ). ’ I said, ‘No I’m not. Don’t be silly. ’ I didn’t think I could do anything like that. Studying was so difficult because I had to rely on someone to type everything into a computer for me.But that’s changed now. I can do it myself with my voice. Kim, who is the Assistive Technologist  at my school, introduced me to Dragon Dictate and it has opened up the world to me.Kim showed me how to train it to understand my voice, it took a few hours. Now I use it in class and at home as well. It has made me more independent and I am now able to study on my own. So now I’m doing my Maths GCSE. I know my teacher will be proud of me.Former President A.P .J. Abdul Kalam was concerned about people with disability and, along with his team, developed lightweight prosthetics from space-age material to enable disabled children to walk easily.I never thought I’ d be able to do one GCSE in my life, but I’m going to do two. And I feel like I want to push myself even further. Kim says technology can help me do that, it is opening up the world for young disabled people like me.There are many different types of technology that can help a young disabled person become independent. For example, if someone has very limited movement they can control a computer screen with Eye Gaze . That means when they’re reading they can move from page to page using the pupils of their eyes. They don’t need to press a button or anything.Just one person, Kim, works with all 42 students here at my school and helps us use technology in different ways. She’s amazing. I don’t know what we’ d do without her we’ d lose out on so many opportunities.It has opened up the world to me.21 - year - old David says, “Technology is very important because it enables me to communicate and be independent, which gives me freedom. ”c.

It has a Bluetooth adaptor, so it lets him use any PC or Mac by sending commands through the Liberator.“It was a great feeling when I learnt to use it, it took me a couple of weeks. Communicating with people was very diﬃcult before. ”He has an ACTIV controller also in the headrest of his chair in his bedroom, which means he can control his TV , Blu-Ray and music players.David was born with Athetoid Cerebral Palsy and attends a specialist school and college. He has been using a high tech communication aid since he was eight years old and has been interested in AAC(Augmentative and Alternative Communication) and technology ever since! When David first started out with AAC, he used a head switch to access his AAC device running a page - based system, which took lots of navigation and required a lot of effort combined with switching. He now uses an ECO2 with ECO point, making his selections with a foot switch once he has fixed his gaze on the icon that is required. He has a smaller communication aid. It has been mounted on his walker. It is essential that much of his spare time is spent in the performing arts! David is also a keen sportsman, regularly playing football, boccia, hockey and baseball. He is a sports leader and uses his ECO2 linked to an interactive white board to teach PE lessons. David has 144 icons on the screen that he uses with ECO point Eye Gaze. When David first tried this access method, his response was “I like it, it makes me faster, when can I have one?” Now David uses his ECO2 and ECO point to access the curriculum, study for his GCSE, order food and communicate while he is in restaurants and argue with his brother. Y ou name it, David can communicate it! David will now use his ECO2 to speak in complete sentences with correct syntax. It has increased the number of words he uses meaningfully and comment socially using the language of his peers, thereby becoming a confident and competent communicator. David has recently been working on idioms with his SLT, his latest being \"Mum has got a lot on her plate!\" David is also an advocate to other students who use AAC and shows them how easy it is to communicate using the AC method. He controls his PlayStation with a bespoke switch system, drives his electric wheelchair with head switches and uses the ECOpoint Eye Gaze system to communicate, access the computer to check on how the Chelsea football team is 10th English_Unit_5.indd128 30-11-202216:14:38www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

An abbreviation is typically a shortened form of words used to represent the whole (such as Dr. or Prof.) while an acronym contains a set of initial letters from a phrase that usually form another word (such as radar or scuba).Abbreviations and acronyms are often interchanged, yet the two are quite distinct. The main point of reference is that abbreviations are merely a series of letters while acronyms form new words.We use contractions (I’m, we’re) in everyday speech and informal writing. Contractions, which are sometimes called ‘short forms’ , commonly combine a pronoun or noun and a verb, or a verb and not, in a shorter form. Contractions with I, you, he, she, it, we, and they’m = am (I’m)’re = are (you’re, we’re, they’re)’s = is and has (he’s, she’s, it’s)’ve = have (I’ve, you’ve, we’ve, they’ve)’ll = will (I’ll, you’ll, he’ll, she’ll, it’ll, we’ll, they’ll)’ d = had and would (I’ d, you’ d, he’ d, she’ d, it’ d, we’ d, they’ d)Contractions with auxiliary verb and notThe contraction for not is n’t:aren’t  = are not (we aren’t, you aren’t)can’t  = cannotcouldn’t  = could notdidn’t  = did not (I didn’t, they didn’t)C.

When a woman was crossing the road with  heavy luggage, Ravi asked the woman, “May I help you?” and carried the luggage and dropped the luggage at home. The woman thanked Ravi for the help.Rani is a brilliant girl. Rani lives in an urban area where huge buildings touch the sky, buzzing noise of traffic hit the ears and crowds move busily towards work. One day when Rani was on the way to school, Rani saw a dog hurt by a moving scooter. At once Rani went near the dog, lifted the dog and rushed to a veterinary doctor.

In the beginning the reader gets informed about how machines are produced and what kind of treatment they need. Afterwards the machines explain how they can serve humanity. The poem ends with the statement that machines, although capable of great deeds, are still nothing more than creations of the human brain.148Rudyard Kipling10th English_Unit_5.indd148 30-11-202216:14:51www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

Though the transmission of speech by the electric current was already very old, it was only since yesterday that vision could also be transmitted. A valuable discovery, and Francis Bennett was by no means the only one to bless its inventor when, in spite of the enormous distance between them, he saw his wife appear in the telephotic mirror. ‘Francis … dear Francis!... ’His name, spoken by that sweet voice, gave a happier turn to Francis Bennett’s mood. He quickly jumped out of bed and went into his mechanized dressing room. Two minutes later, without needing the help of a valet, the machine deposited Supplementary 5A day in 2889 of an American JournalistJules VerneThe year is 2889, the date 25th July and the place is the office block of the Managing Editor of the Earth Herald, the world’s largest newspaper. In this futuristic story written in 1889, the writer describes how he visualizes the world a thousand years later – a world of technological advancements where newspapers are not printed but ‘spoken’ . Read the following excerpt for a glimpse of this future world.That morning Francis Bennett awoke in rather a bad temper. This was eight days since his wife had been in France and he was feeling a little lonely. As soon as he awoke, Francis Bennett switched on his phonotelephote  whose wires led to the house he owned in the Champs-Elysees.This story speaks about the people of the twenty-ninth century who live in fairyland. Surfeited as they are with marvels, they are indifferent to the presence of each new marvel. To them all seem natural.10th English_Unit_5.indd153 30-11-202216:14:53www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

His fifteen hundred reporters, placed before an equal number of telephones, were passing on to subscribers the news which had come in during the night from the four quarters of the earth. In addition to his telephone, each reporter has in front of him a series of commutators , which allow him to get into communication with this or that telephotic line.Thus the subscribers have not only the story but the sight of these events.Francis Bennett questioned one of the ten astronomical reporters – a service which was growing because of the recent discoveries in the stellar world.‘Well, Cash, what have you got?’‘Phototelegrams from Mercury, Venus and Mars, Sir. ’‘Interesting! And Jupiter?’‘Nothing so far! We haven’t been able to understand the signals the Jovians  make. Perhaps ours haven’t reached them? …. ’‘ Aren’t you getting some result from the moon, at any rate?’‘Not yet, Mr Bennett. ’‘Well, this time, you can’t blame optical science! The moon is six hundred times nearer than Mars, and yet our correspondence service is in regular operation with Mars. It can’t be telescopes we need… ’‘No, it’s the inhabitants , ’ Corley replied.‘Y ou dare tell me that the moon is uninhabited?’‘On the face it turns towards us, at any rate, Mr Bennett. Who knows whether on the other side… ’‘Well, there’s a very simple method of finding out. ’10th English_Unit_5.indd154 30-11-202216:14:53www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

One of the Earth Herald’s astronomers had just determined the elements of the new planet Gandini. It is at a distance of 12,841,348,284,623 metres and 7 decimetres that this planet describes its orbit round the sun in 572 years, 194 days, 12 hours, 43 minutes, 9.8 seconds. Francis Bennett was delighted with such precision.‘Good!’ he exclaimed. ‘Hurry up and tell the reportage service about it. Y ou know what a passion the public has for these astronomical questions. I’m anxious for the news to appear in today’s issue!’The next room, a broad gallery about a quarter of a mile long, was devoted to publicity, and it well may be imagined what the publicity for such a journal as the Earth Herald had to be. It brought in a daily average of three million dollars. They are gigantic signs reflected on the clouds, so large that they can be seen all over a whole country. From that gallery a thousand projectors were unceasingly employed in sending to the clouds, on which they were reproduced in colour, these inordinate advertisements.At that moment the clock struck twelve. The director of the Earth Herald left the hall and sat down in a rolling armchair. In a few minutes he had reached his dining room half a mile away, at the far end of the office.The table was laid and he took his place at it. Within reach of his hand was placed a series of taps and before him was the curved surface of a phonotelephote, on which appeared the dining room of his home in Paris. Mr and Mrs Bennett had arranged to have lunch at the same time – nothing could be more pleasant than to be face to face in spite of the distance, to see one another and talk by means of the phonotelephotic apparatus.Like everybody else in easy circumstances nowadays, Francis Bennett, having abandoned domestic cooking, is one of the subscribers to the Society for Supplying Food to the Home, which distributes dishes of a thousand types through a network of pneumatic tubes. This system is expensive, no doubt, but the cooking is better. So, not without some regret, Francis Bennett was lunching in solitude. He was finishing his coffee when Mrs Bennett, having got back home, appeared in the telephote screen.10th English_Unit_5.indd155 30-11-202216:14:53www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 156When he had finished his lunch, he went across to the window, where his aero-car was waiting.‘Where are we going, Sir?’ asked the aero-coachman. ‘Let’s see. I’ve got time… ’ Francis Bennett replied. ‘Take me to my accumulator works at Niagara. ’The aero-car shot across space at a speed of about four hundred miles an hour. Below him were spread out the towns with their moving pavements which carry the wayfarers along the streets, and the countryside, covered, as though by an immense spider’s web, by the network of electric wires.Within half an hour, Francis Bennett had reached his works at Niagara, where, after using the force of the cataracts to produce energy, he sold or hired it out to the consumers. Then he returned, by way of Philadelphia, Boston and New Y ork, to Centropolis, where his aero-car put him down about five o’ clock.The waiting-room of the Earth Herald was crowded. A careful lookout was being kept for Francis Bennett to return for the daily audience he gave to his petitioners. Among their different proposals he had to make a choice, reject the bad ones, look into the doubtful ones, and welcome the good ones.He soon got rid of those who had only useless or impracticable schemes. A few of the others received a better welcome, and foremost among them was a young man whose broad brow indicated a high degree of intelligence.‘Sir’ , he began, ‘though the number of elements used to be estimated at seventy-five, it has now been reduced to three, as no doubt you are aware?’‘Perfectly, ’ Francis Bennett replied.‘Well, Sir, I’m on the point of reducing the three to one. If I don’t run out of money I’ll have succeeded in three weeks. ’‘ And then?’‘Then, Sir, I shall really have discovered the absolute’ .‘ And the results of that discovery?’‘It will be to make the creation of all forms of matter easy – stone, wood, metal, fibrin …. ’‘ Are you saying you’re going to be able to construct a human being?’‘Complete… The only thing missing will be the soul!’Francis Bennett assigned the young fellow to the scientific editorial department of his journal.10th English_Unit_5.indd156 30-11-202216:14:54www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 157A second inventor, using as a basis some old experiments that dated from the 19th century, had the idea of moving a whole city in a single block. He suggested, as a demonstration, the town of Saaf, situated fifteen miles from the sea; after conveying it on rails down to the shore, he would transform it into a seaside resort. Francis Bennett, attracted by this project, agreed to take a half-share in it.The proposals heard and dealt with, Francis Bennett went to stretch himself out in an easy-chair in the audition-room. Then, pressing a button, he was put into communication with the Central Concert. After so busy a day, what charm he found in the works of our greatest masters, based on a series of delicious harmonico-algebraic formulae! During his meal, phonotelephotic communication had been set up with Paris.‘When do you expect to get back to Centropolis, dear Edith?’ asked Francis Bennett.‘I’m going to start this moment’ .‘By tube or aero-train?’‘ B y  t u b e’.‘Then you’ll be here?’‘ At eleven fifty-nine this evening’ .‘Paris time?’‘No, no! … Centropolis time’ .‘Goodbye then, and above all don’t miss the tube!’These submarine tubes, by which one travels from Paris in two hundred and ninety-five minutes, are certainly much preferable to the aero-trains, which only manage six hundred miles an hour.Francis Bennett, very tired after so very full a day, decided to take a bath before going to bed. There was always a bath already in the office. He touched the button. A rumbling sound began, got louder, increased … Then one of the doors opened and the bath appeared, gliding along on its rails …Glossary phonotelephote(n): a means of transmitting and receiving both voice and picture for a personal conversationChamps-Elysees(n): a prestigious avenue in Paris, famous for the Cafes, cinemas and shopsphototelegrams (n): a telegraphic transmission including imagesjovians(n): inhabitants of planet Jupiterinhabitants(n): a person or animal that lives in or occupies a place.Centropolis (n): (in this story) the new name of New Y ork in 2889valet(n): a man’s personal male attendant, who is responsible for his clothes and appearanceAbout the authorJules Verne (1828–1905) was a French poet, playwright and novelist but he earns his place on this list of great writers because of his futuristic adventure novels. He has been called the father of science fiction and has had an incalculable influence on the development of science fiction writing. More interesting, perhaps, is his place as a prophet or predictor of technology which wasn’t to be invented until long after his death. He put a man on the moon, including its launch from a Florida launchpad to its splashdown in the Pacific; in 1863 he predicted the internet: Paris in the 20th Century (1863) depicts the details of modern life: skyscrapers, television, Maglev trains, computers, and a culture preoccupied with the Internet.10th English_Unit_5.indd157 30-11-202216:14:54www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

              " 162Prose 6The Last LessonI started for school very late that morning and was in great dread of a scolding, especially because M. Hamel had said that he would question us on participles, and I did not know the first word about them. For a moment I thought of running away and spending the day out of doors. It was so warm, so bright! The birds were chirping at the edge of the woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the strength to resist, and hurried off to school. When I passed the town hall there was a crowd in front of the bulletin-board. For the last two years all our bad news had come from there — the lost battles, the draft, the orders of the commanding officer — and I thought to myself, without stopping, “What can be the matter now?”This lesson is set in the days of France-Prussian war. France was ruled by Bismarck. Prussia then consisted of what now are the nations of Germany, Polland, and parts of Austria. The Prussians defeated the French and the districts of Alsace and Lorraine fell into the hands of the Prussians. The oppressors not only wanted the territory but dominated over the language and culture of the Germans, thus to take away their identity. Read the lesson to find out what impact this had on life at school.Alphonse Daudet10th English_Unit_6.indd162 28-11-202218:59:44www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 163Then, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the blacksmith, Wachter, who was there, with his apprentice, reading the bulletin, called after me, “Don’t go so fast, bub; you’ll get to your school in plenty of time!” I thought he was making fun of me, and reached M. Hamel’s little garden all out of breath. Usually, when school began, there was a great bustle , which could be heard out in the street, the opening and closing of desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with our hands over our ears to understand better, and the teacher’s great ruler rapping on the table. But now it was all so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my desk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had to open the door and go in before everybody. Y ou can imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was. But nothing happened. M. Hamel saw me and said very kindly, “Go to your place quickly, little Franz. We were beginning without you. ” I jumped over the bench and sat down at my desk. Not till then, when I had got a little over my fright, did I see that our a.  What kind of news was usually put up on the bulletin board? b.  What was the usual scene when school began everyday?teacher had on his beautiful green coat, his frilled shirt, and the little black silk cap, all embroidered, that he never wore except on inspection and prize days. Besides, the whole school seemed so strange and solemn. But the thing that surprised me most was to see, on the back benches that were always empty, the village people sitting quietly like ourselves; old Hauser, with his three-cornered hat, the former mayor, the former postmaster, and several others besides. Everybody looked sad; and Hauser had brought an old primer, thumbed  at the edges, and he held it open on his knees with his great spectacles lying across the pages. While I was wondering about it all, M. Hamel mounted his chair, and, in the same grave and gentle tone which he had used to me, said, “My children, this is the last lesson I shall give you. The order has come from Berlin to teach only German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The new master comes tomorrow. This is your last French lesson. I want you to be very attentive.”  What a thunderclap these words were to me!10th English_Unit_6.indd163 28-11-202218:59:44www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 164Oh, the wretches; that was what they had put up at the town-hall! My last French lesson! Why, I hardly knew how to write! I should never learn anymore! I must stop there, then! Oh, how sorry I was for not learning my lessons, for seeking birds’ eggs, or going sliding on the *Saar! My books, that had seemed such a nuisance a while ago, so heavy to carry, my grammar, and my history of the saints, were old friends now that I couldn’t give up. And M. Hamel, too; the idea that he was going away, that I should never see him again, made me forget all about his ruler and how cranky he was.Poor man! It was in honour of this last lesson that he had put on his fine Sunday clothes, and now I understood why the old men of the village were sitting there in the back of the room. It was because they were sorry, too, that they had not gone to school more. It was their way of thanking our master for his forty years of faithful service and of showing their respect for the country that was theirs no more. While I was thinking of all this, I heard my name called. It was my turn to recite. What would I not have given to be able to say that dreadful rule for the participle all through, very loud and clear, and without one mistake? But I got mixed up on the first words and stood there, holding on to my desk, my heart beating, and not daring to look up. c.  Other than the students, who were present in the class?d.  Why did M. Hamel say it was the last French lesson?I heard M. Hamel say to me, “I won’t scold you, little Franz; you must feel bad enough. See how it is! Every day we have said to ourselves, ‘Bah! I’ve plenty of time. I’ll learn it tomorrow. ’ And now you see where we’ve come out. Ah, that’s the great trouble with Alsace; she puts off learning till tomorrow. Now those fellows out there will have the right to say to you, ‘How is it; you pretend to be Frenchmen, and yet you can neither speak nor write your own language?’ But you are not the worst, poor little Franz. We’ve all a great deal to reproach ourselves with. ”“Y our parents were not anxious enough to have you learn. They preferred to put you to work on a farm or at the mills, so as to have a little more money. And I? I’ve been to blame also. Have I not often sent you to water my flowers instead of learning your lessons? And when I wanted to go fishing, did I not just give you a holiday?” Then, from one thing to another, M. Hamel went on to talk of the French language, saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world — the clearest, the most logical; that we must guard it among us and never forget it, because when a people are enslaved, as long as they hold fast to their language it is as if they had the key to their prison. Then he opened a grammar and read us our lesson. I was amazed to see how well I understood it. All he said seemed e.  What was Franz asked to tell? Was he able to answer?f.  Why did M.Hamel blame himself?10th English_Unit_6.indd164 28-11-202218:59:44www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 165so easy, so easy! I think, too, that I had never listened so carefully, and that he had never explained everything with so much patience. It seemed almost as if the poor man wanted to give us all he knew before going away, and to put it all into our heads at one stroke. After the grammar, we had a lesson in writing. That day M. Hamel had new copies for us, written in a beautiful round hand — France, Alsace, France, Alsace. They looked like little flags floating everywhere in the school-room, hung from the rod at the top of our desks. Y ou ought to have seen how everyone set to work, and how quiet it was! The only sound was the scratching of the pens over the paper. Once some beetles flew in; but nobody paid any attention to them, not even the littlest ones, who worked right on tracing their fish-hooks, as if that was French, too. On the roof the pigeons cooed very low, and I thought to myself, “Will they make them sing in German, even the pigeons?” Whenever I looked up from my writing I saw M. Hamel sitting motionless in his chair and gazing first at one thing, then at another, as if he wanted to fix in his mind just how everything looked in that little school-room. Fancy! For forty years he had been there in the same place, with his garden outside the window and his class in front of him, just like that. Only the desks and benches had been worn smooth; the walnut-trees in the garden were taller, and the hopvine that he had planted himself twined about the windows to the roof. How it must have broken his heart to leave it all, poor man; to hear his sister moving about in the room above, packing their trunks! For they must leave the country next day. But he had the courage to hear every lesson to the very last. After the writing, we had a lesson in history, and then the babies chanted their ba, be bi, bo, bu. Down there at the back of the room old Hauser had put on his spectacles and, holding his primer in both hands, spelled the letters with them. Y ou could see that he, too, was crying; his voice trembled with emotion, and it was so funny to hear him that we all wanted to laugh and cry. Ah, how well I remember it, that last lesson! All at once the church-clock struck twelve. Then  the Angelus . At the same moment the trumpets of the Prussians, returning from drill, sounded under our windows. M. Hamel stood up, very pale, in his chair. I never saw him look so tall. “My friends, ” said he, “I—I—” But something choked him. He could not go on. Then he turned to the blackboard, took a piece of chalk, and, bearing on with all his might, he wrote as large as he  could - “ Vive La France!” Then he stopped and leaned his head against the wall, and, without a word, he made a gesture to us with his hand — “School is dismissed — you may go. ”g.

In the lines, They, too, aware of sun and air and water,Are fed by peaceful harvests, by war's long winter starv'd. \"starv'd\" is an epithet which is placed beside the noun 'winter'. However, it does not describe the 'winter' as being starved, but describes the pronoun 'they'. Historically many wars were fought during the winter, while the harvest season was essentially peaceful. 'They' refers to the soldiers in uniform who had to starve during winter while fighting for their land.e.g., Winter starv’d – transferred epithetMetaphorA figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable. Recorded from the late 15th century, the word comes via French and Latin from Greek metaphora, from metapherein ‘to transfer’.e.g., Hells of fire - metaphorRepetitionPoets often repeat single words or phrases, lines, and sometimes, even whole stanzas at intervals to create a musical effect; to emphasize a point; to draw the readers’ attention or to lend unity to a piece. In “No Men are Foreign” James Kirkup repeats the word ‘Remember’ five times in the poem to emphasize the 10th English_Unit_6.indd181 28-11-202218:59:47www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

Similarly, the last line of the last stanza (“Remember, no men are foreign, and no countries strange”) though reversed, is the same as the first line of the first stanza (“Remember, no men are strange, no countries foreign”). This repetition emphasizes the core message of the oneness of mankind.Based on your understanding of the poem complete the following by choosing the appropriate words/phrases given in brackets:  This poem is about the ___(1)___  of all men.

              " 183This is a true story of a little boy  with a brave heart and passionate love for his village. Read on the story to find what the little hero of Holland did to save his fellowmen.6The Little Hero of Holland Supplementaryhe remembered  his mother’s wish that he should return before dark and, bidding his friend goodbye, he set out for home.As he walked beside the canal, he noticed how the rains had swollen the waters, and how they beat against the side of the dike, and he thought of his father’s gates.“I am glad they are so strong,” he said to himself. “If they gave way what would become of us? These pretty fields would be covered with water. Father always calls them the `angry waters. ´ I suppose he thinks they are angry at him for keeping them out so long.”As he walked along he sometimes stopped to pick the pretty blue flowers that grew beside the road, or to listen to the rabbits´soft tread as they rustled through the grass. But oftener he smiled Holland is a country where much of the land lies below sea level. Only great walls called dikes  keep the North Sea from rushing in and flooding the land. For centuries the people of Holland have worked to keep the walls strong so that their country will be safe and dry. Even the little children know the dikes must be watched every moment, and that a hole no longer than your finger can be a very dangerous thing. Many years ago there lived in Holland a boy named Peter. Peter’s father was one of the men who tended the gates in the dikes, called sluice . He opened and closed the sluices so that ships could pass out of Holland’s canals into the great sea. One afternoon in the early fall, when Peter was eight years old, his mother called him from his play. “Come, Peter,” she said. “I want you to go across the dike and take these cakes to your friend, the blind man. If you go quickly, and do not stop  to play, you will be home again before dark.”The little boy was glad to go on such an errand, and started off with a light heart. He stayed with the poor blind man a little while to tell him about his walk along the dike and about the sun and the flowers and the ships far out at sea. Then 10th English_Unit_6.indd183 28-11-202218:59:47www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 184as he thought of his visit to the poor blind man who had so few pleasures and was always so glad to see him.Suddenly he noticed that the sun was setting, and that it was growing dark. “Mother will be watching for me,” he thought, and he began to run toward home.Just then he heard a noise. It was the sound of trickling  water! He stopped and looked down. There was a small hole in the dike, through which a tiny stream was flowing,Any child in Holland is frightened at the thought of a leak in the dike.Peter understood the danger at once. If the water ran through a little hole it would soon make a larger one, and the whole country would be flooded. In a moment he saw what he must do. Throwing away his flowers, he climbed down the side of the dike and thrust his finger into the tiny hole.The flowing of the water was stopped!“Oho!” he said to himself. “The angry waters must stay back now. I can keep them back with my finger. Holland shall not be drowned while I am here.”This was all very well at first, but soon it grew dark and cold. The little fellow shouted and screamed. “Come here; come here,” he called. But no one heard him; no one came to help him.It grew still colder, and his arm ached, and began to grow stiff and numb. He shouted again. “Will no one come? Mother! Mother!”But his mother had looked anxiously along the dike road many times since sunset for her little boy, and now she had closed and locked the cottage door, thinking that Peter was spending the night with his blind friend, and that she would scold him in the morning for staying away from home without permission. Peter tried to whistle, but his teeth chattered  with the cold. He thought of his brother and sister in their warm beds, and of his dear father and mother. “I must not let them be drowned,” he thought. “I must stay here until someone comes, if I have to stay all night.”The moon and stars looked down on the child crouching  on a stone on the side of the dike. His head was bent, and his eyes were closed, but he was not asleep, for every now and then he rubbed the hand that was holding back the angry sea.“I’ll stand it somehow,” he thought. So he stayed there all night keeping the sea out.10th English_Unit_6.indd184 28-11-202218:59:48www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 185Early the next morning a man going to work thought he heard a groan  as he walked along the top of the dike. Looking over the edge, he saw a child clinging to the side of the great wall.“What’s the matter?” he called. “Are you hurt?”“I’m keeping the water back!” Peter yelled. “Tell them to come quickly!”The alarm was spread. People came running with shovels  and the hole was soon mended.They carried Peter home to his parents, and before long the whole town knew how he had saved their lives that night. To this day, they have never forgotten the brave little hero of Holland.About the authorMary Mapes  Dodge (1831–1905) was an American children's author and editor, best known for her novel Hans Brinker.

Do you think this can stop me?” I said advancing towards him.“If you will stand there, I will talk. If you don’t you must leave the room, ” said my master.I have always given in to Holmes’ wishes. But now my feelings as a doctor were aroused. I was at least his master in the sick-room.“Holmes, ” I said, “you are not yourself whether you like it or not. I will examine your symptoms and treat you. ”Prose 7The Dying DetectiveArthur Conan DoyleThe detective Sherlock Holmes was seriously ill. He wanted to meet his assistant Watson.

But facts are facts, Watson. Y ou are a general practitioner, not a specialist of this disease. ”“If so, let me bring Sir Japer Meek or Penrose Fisher, or any other best man in London. ”“How ignorant you are! Watson!” he said with a groan .“What do you know about Tarpaunli fever or the black Formosa plague?”“I have never heard of them, ”  I admitted.“There are many problems of the disease in the East. I have learnt that much during my recent researches. And during this course I caught this illness, ” he said.“I will bring Dr. Ainstree then, ”  I said going towards the door. Never have I had such a shock when the dying man bolted  the door and locked it, shouted in an uncontrolled way and in a moment he was back in his bed.“Y ou won’t have the key by force from me Watson.

At six we will talk again. ”Unable to settle down to reading, I walked slowly round and round, looking at the pictures. Finally I came to the mantle piece , where among other things I saw a small black and white ivory box with sliding lid. As I held it in my hand to examine it, I heard a dreadful cry. “Put it down! Down at once, Watson, ” he said,  “I hate to have my things touched.  Sit down man, and let me have my rest!”Then I sat in silent dejection until the stipulated time had passed.  “Now Watson, ” he said, “Have you any change?”“Y es, ” I replied.“How many half-crowns? Put them in your watch – pocket. And all the rest in your trouser pocket. Y ou will light the gas lamp, but it must be half on.

Now you can go and fetch Mr. Culverton Smith, of 13 Lower Burke Street’’ .I was hesitant to leave him now. He was delirious.“I have never heard of the name, ’’ I said.“Well, he is the man who has the knowledge of this disease but he is not a medical man. He is a planter. He lives in Sumatra, now visiting London. I didn’t want you to go before six, because you wouldn’t have found him in his study.  I hope you will be able to persuade him to come. Y ou will tell him exactly how you have left me. ” He said, “Y ou must tell him that I’m dying – plead with him, Watson. ”“I’ll bring him in a cab, ’’ I said.“No. Y ou will persuade him to come and return before him. Make any excuse. Remember this, Watson. ”I saw Mrs. Hudson was waiting outside, trembling and crying. Below, as I waited for the cab, I met Inspector Morton of the Scotland Y ard. He was not in his uniform.“How is he?” asked Inspector Morton.“He is very ill, ” I answered.I reached Mr. Culverton Smith’s house. The butler appeared at the doorway. Through the half-open door I heard a man’s voice telling the butler, “I am not at home, say so. ” I pushed past the butler and entered the room. I saw a frail  man with bald head sitting. “I am sorry, ” I said, “but the matter cannot be delayed. Mr. Sherlock Holmes…………. ”The mere mention of his name had a different effect on the man.“Have you come from Holmes? How is he?” he asked.“He is very ill. That is why I have come. Mr. Holmes has a high opinion of you and thought you are the only man in London who can help him. ”The little man was startled .“Why?” he asked.“Because of your knowledge of the Eastern diseases, ” I replied.“How did he get it?” he asked.I told him everything. He smiled and agreed to come. Pretending that I had some other appointment. I left him. With a sinking heart I reached Holmes’ room.  I told him that Mr. Smith was coming.“Well done! Watson!” he said. “Y ou have done everything that a good friend could do. Now you disappear to the next room. And don’t speak, or come here. ”10th English_Unit_7.indd191 28-11-202218:51:01www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

Y ou are the only one in London who can cure me. ”“Do you know the symptoms?” asked Smith.“Only too well, Mr. Smith, ” and he described the symptoms.“They are the same, Holmes, ” Smith said, “Poor Victor was a dead man on the fourth day -a  strong and healthy young man. What a coincidence indeed!”“I know that you did it, ” said Holmes.“Well, you can’t prove it. ”“Give me water, please, ” Holmes groaned.“Here. ” I heard Smith’s voice.“Cure me, please. Well, about Victor Savage’s death. Y ou did it. I’ll forget everything, but cure me. I’ll forget about it. ”“Y ou can forget or remember, just as you like. It doesn’t matter to me how my nephew died. Watson said you got it from the Chinese sailors. Could there be any other reason?”“I can’t think. My mind is gone, help me, ” pleaded Holmes.“Did anything come by post? A box by chance? On Wednesday?”“Y es I opened it and there was a sharp spring inside it. A joke perhaps. It drew blood, ” said Holmes.“No, it was not a joke, you fool, you’ve got it. Who asked you to cross my path? Y ou knew too much about Victor’s death. Y our end is near, Holmes. I’ll carry this box in my pocket. The last piece of evidence!”  “Turn up the gas, Smith, ” said Holmes in his natural voice.“Y es I will, so that I can see you better. ”  There was silence. Then I heard Smith say, “What’s all this?”“Successful acting, ” said Holmes, “for three days I didn’t taste anything – neither food nor drink. ”There were footsteps outside.

There was a click of handcuffs. Holmes asked me to come in.“Sorry, Watson, I was rude to you.  I undermined your capability as a doctor. It wasjust to get Smith here. And I didn’t want you to know that I was not ill. ”“But your appearance--?” I said.“Three days, fasting and the make-up did the trick. ” “The coins?”“Oh!

Then, at 10.30, John Mathew answered his mail, returned phone calls and rearranged his social calendar helped by Louise, his secretary. At noon, John Mathew drove his Jaguar to the station and took a commuter train into Guindy for his weekly lunch with Lalli and Lolly, his two oldest and dearest friends. Then, on to a little shopping. The 4:05 nonstop would bring him back to Tambaram. As John Mathew drove up to the house at 5:00, Basky would have already set up the massage table and warmed the scented oils for a soothing herbal wrap. It was a gruelling life but John seemed to thrive on it. On this Wednesday, however, there was an unexpected change of plans. Today John’s shopping errand involved taking his diamond bracelet into the jeweller’s for cleaning. He threw the expensive jewel into his purse and proceeded on to lunch.As John waved his friends good-bye and exited the restaurant, he sensed he was being followed. The feeling continued until he reached Tenth Avenue. Then, as he joined the throng of shoppers, John felt a hug.

              " 205I was just thirty-seven when my Uncle Philip died. A week before that event he sent for me; and here let me say that I had never set eyes on him. He hated my mother, but I do not know why. She told me long before his last illness that I need expect nothing from my father’s brother. He was an inventor, an able and ingenious mechanical engineer, and had much money by his improvement in turbine-wheels. He was a bachelor; lived alone, cooked his own meals, and collected precious stones, especially rubies and pearls. From the time he made his first money he had this mania . As he grew richer, the desire to possess rare and costly gems became stronger. When he bought a new stone, he carried it in his pocket for a month and now and then took it out and looked at it. Then it was added to the collection in his safe at the trust company.Supplementary 7A DilemmaSilas Weir MitchellAt the time he sent for me I was a clerk, and poor enough. Remembering my mother’s words, his message gave me, his sole relative, no new hopes; but I thought it best to go. When I sat down by his bedside, he began, with a malicious grin:“I suppose you think me queer .  I will explain. ” What he said was certainly queer enough. “I have been living on an annuity into which I put my fortune. In other words, I have been, as to money, concentric half of my life to enable me to be as eccentric as I pleased the rest of it. Now I repent of my wickedness to you all, and desire to live in the memory of at least one of my family. Y ou think I am poor and have only my annuity. Y ou will be profitably surprised. I have never parted with my precious stones; they will be yours. Y ou are my sole heir. I shall carry with me to the other world the satisfaction of making one man happy. “No doubt you have always had expectations, and I desire that you should continue to expect. My jewels are in my safe. There is nothing else left” .When I thanked him he grinned all over his lean face, and said:“Y ou will have to pay for my funeral. ”10th English_Unit_7.indd205 28-11-202218:51:06www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 206I must say that I never looked forward to any expenditure with more pleasure than to what it would cost me to put him away in the earth. As I rose to go, he said:“The rubies are valuable. They are in my safe at the trust company. Before you unlock the box, be very careful to read a letter which lies on top of it; and be sure not to shake the box. ” I thought this odd. “Don’t come back. It won’t hasten things. ”He died that day next week, and was handsomely buried. The day after, his will was found, leaving me his heir. I opened his safe and found in it nothing but an iron box, evidently of his own making, for he was a skilled workman and very ingenious. The box was heavy and strong, about ten inches long, eight inches wide and ten inches high. On it lay a letter to me. It ran thus:I stood appalled , the key in my hand. Was it true? Was it a lie? I had spent all my savings on the funeral, and was poorer than ever.Remembering the old man’s oddity , his malice, his cleverness in mechanic arts, and the patent explosive which had helped to make him rich, I began to feel how very likely it was that he had told the truth in this cruel letter. I carried the iron box away to my lodgings, set it down with care in a closet, laid the key on it, and locked the closet.  “DEAR TOM: This box contains a large number of very fine pigeon-blood rubies and a fair lot of diamonds; one is blue—a beauty. There are hundreds of pearls—one the famous green pearl and a necklace of blue pearls, for which any woman would sell her soul—or her affections. ” I thought of Susan. “I wish you to continue to have expectations and continuously to remember your dear uncle. I would have left these stones to some charity, but I hate the poor as much as I hate your mother’s son,—yes, rather more. The box contains an interesting mechanism, which will act with certainty as you unlock it, and explode ten ounces of my improved, supersensitive dynamite—no, to be accurate, there are only nine and a half ounces. Doubt me, and open it, and you will be blown to atoms. Believe me, and you will continue to nourish expectations which will never be fulfilled. As a considerate man, I counsel extreme care in handling the box. Don’t forget your affectionate uncle” .10th English_Unit_7.indd206 28-11-202218:51:06www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 207Then I sat down, as yet hopeful, and began to exert my ingenuity upon ways of opening the box without being killed. There must be a way. After a week of vain thinking I bethought me, one day, that it would be easy to explode the box by unlocking it at a safe distance, and I arranged a plan with wires, which seemed as if it would answer. But when I reflected on what would happen when the dynamite scattered the rubies, I knew that I should be none the richer. For hours at a time I sat looking at that box and handling the key. At last I hung the key on my watch-guard; but then it occurred to me that it might be lost or stolen. Dreading this, I hid it, fearful that someone might use it to open the box. This state of doubt and fear lasted for weeks, until I became nervous and began to dread that some accident might happen to that box. A burglar might come and boldly carry it away and force it open and find it was a wicked fraud of my uncle’s. Even the rumble and vibration caused by the heavy vans in the street became at last a terror.Worst of all, my salary was reduced, and I saw that marriage was out of the question.In my despair I consulted Professor Clinch about my dilemma, and as to some safe way of getting at the rubies. He said that, if my uncle had not lied, there was none that would not ruin the stones, especially the pearls, but that it was a silly tale and altogether incredible . I offered him the biggest ruby if he wished to test his opinion. He did not desire to do so.Dr. Schaff, my uncle’s doctor, believed the old man’s letter, and added a caution, which was entirely useless, for by this time I was afraid to be in the room with that terrible box.At last the doctor kindly warned me that I was in danger of losing my mind with too much thought about my rubies. In fact, I did nothing else but contrive  wild plans to get at them safely. I spent all my spare hours at one of the great libraries reading about dynamite. 10th English_Unit_7.indd207 28-11-202218:51:07www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 208Indeed, I talked of it until the library attendants, believing me a lunatic or a dynamite fiend, declined to humor me, and spoke to the police. I suspect that for a while I was “shadowed” as a suspicious, and possibly criminal, character. I gave up the libraries, and, becoming more and more fearful, set my precious box on a down pillow, for fear of its being shaken; for at this time even the absurd possibility of its being disturbed by an earthquake troubled me. I tried to calculate the amount of shake needed to explode my box.The old doctor, when I saw him again, begged me to give up all thought of the matter, and, as I felt how completely I was the slave of one despotic idea, I tried to take the good advice thus given me. Unhappily, I found, soon after, between the leaves of my uncle’s Bible, a numbered list of the stones with their cost and much beside. It was dated two years before my uncle’s death. Many of the stones were well known, and their enormous value amazed me.Several of the rubies were described with care, and curious histories of them were given in detail. One was said to be the famous “Sunset ruby, ” which had belonged to the Empress-Queen Maria Theresa. One was called the “Blood ruby, ” not, as was explained, because of the color, but on account of the murders it had occasioned. Now, as I read, it seemed again to threaten death.The pearls were described with care as an unequalled collection. Concerning two of them my uncle had written what I might call biographies—for, indeed, they seemed to have done much evil and some good. One, a black pearl, was mentioned in an old bill of sale as—She—which seemed queer to me.It was maddening. Here, guarded by a vision of sudden death, was wealth “beyond the dreams of avarice . ” I am not a clever or ingenious man; I know little beyond how to keep a ledger, and so I was, and am, no doubt, absurd about many of my notions as to how to solve this riddle. At one time I thought of finding a man who would take the risk of unlocking the box, but what right had I to subject anyone else to the trial I dared not face? I could easily drop the box from a height somewhere, and if it did not explode could then safely unlock it; but if it did blow up when it fell, good-by to my rubies. Mine, indeed! I was rich, and I was not. I grew thin and morbid, and so miserable that, I at last carried my troubles to my father 10th English_Unit_7.indd208 28-11-202218:51:08www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 209confessor. He thought it simply a cruel jest of my uncle’s, but was not so eager for another world as to be willing to open my box. He, too, counselled me to cease thinking about it. Good heavens! I dreamed about it. Not to think about it was impossible. Neither my own thought nor science nor religion had been able to assist me.Two years have gone by, and I am one of the richest men in the city, and have no more money than will keep me alive. Susan said I was half cracked like Uncle Philip, and broke off her engagement. In my despair I advertised in the Journal of Science, and have had absurd schemes sent me by the dozen. At last, as I talked too much about it, the thing became so well known that when I put the horror in a safe, in a bank, I was promptly desired to withdraw it. I was in constant fear of burglars, and my landlady gave me notice to leave, because no one would stay in the house with that box. I am now advised to print my story and await advice from the ingenuity of the American mind.I have moved into the suburbs and hidden the box and changed my name and my occupation. This I did to escape the curiosity of the reporters. I ought to say that when the government officials came to hear of my inheritance, they were reasonably desired to collect the succession tax on my uncle’s estate. I was delighted to assist them. I told the collector my story, and showed him Uncle Philip’s letter. Then I offered him the key, and asked for time to get half a mile away. That man said he would think it over and come back later. This is all I have to say. I have made a will and left my rubies and pearls to the Society for the Preservation of Human Vivisection .

              " 213Unit – 2A Trip to Remember ForeverOur trip to this wonderful city, Darjeeling started with a breath-taking view. We parted the curtains of our hotel room and there it was, Kanchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world! The entire range was in front of us in full view, snow-capped and dazzling in the sun. Our trip started early in the morning the next day. We woke up at 4 a.m. and reached Tiger hill at 5 a.m. to view the sunrise as the place has earned international fame for the best sunrise view. Tiger hill is situated at an altitude of 2590 meters and is 13 kilometers away from the city. Although Kanchenjunga was visible from the window of our hotel room, viewing it from tiger hill was a different experience altogether. It was not a very cloudy day so we were lucky enough to get a glimpse of the Mount Everest. After Tiger hill, we visited Senchal Lake which is another picnic spot nearby. We were told that the lake supplies drinking water to the city.The next spot on our list was Batasia Loop, a spiral railway near Ghum. The loop is situated 5 kilometers from the city and is a gigantic railway loop where the toy train runs and takes a 360 degree turn. It is a beautiful place with manicured garden, streams and waterfalls. While travelling on the toy train, one gets a breath-taking view of Darjeeling’s scenic beauty. We would suggest the toy train only for people with lot of patience as the train travels at a speed of 15 kilometers per hour and covers 14 kilometers in three hours which might  be  an  utter  disappointment  forsome. Altogether we had a memorable and enjoyable school trip with our friends and it will linger in our thoughts forever.A Short Story : Three Simple RulesThis Short Story Three Simple Rules is quite interesting to all the people. Enjoy reading this story. Once there was a rich man in Thailand. His name was Chulong. He was a very rich man. Y et he wanted more riches, more money. One day he was walking in his garden. He saw a strange bird in a bush. It was very small. But it had very beautiful and colorful features. Its voice was also very sweet. Chulong had never seen such a bird in his life. He slowly went near the bush unseen. He caught the bird. Now the bird began to speak. Unit – 1LISTENING P ASSAGE10th English_Listening Passage.indd213 28-11-202218:30:19www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
              " 214“Why have you caught me?” the bird asked. “I want to make money. I can sell you for a big amount, ” replied Chulong. “But you are already rich. Why do you want more?” asked the bird. “Because I want to become richer and richer, ” replied Chulong. “But do not dream of making money through me!” said the bird. It further added, “Y ou can not sell me. Nobody will buy me, because, in imprisonment, I lose my beauty and my sweet voice. ” Then it slowly turned into a black bird. The beautiful features were now looking like the feathers of a crow. Chulong’s hopes of making money were shattered. He said angrily, “I will kill you, and I will eat your meat. ” “Eat me! I am so small. Y ou will not get any meat out of me, ” replied the bird. Chulong could not answer. The bird then suggested, “Well set me free. In return I shall teach you three simple but useful rules. ” “What is the use of the rules? I want only money, ” said Chulong. He was irritated. “But these rules can profit you greatly, ” added the bird. “Profit me! Really? Then I shall set you free. But how can I trust you? Y ou may fly away, ” said Chulong. “I give you my word. And I always keep my word, ” said the bird. Chulong wanted to take a chance. He released the bird. It flew up at once. Then it sat on the branch of a tree. Its color started changing. It became beautiful again. Chulong asked, “Now teach me the rules. ” “Certainly, ” said the bird. Then it added, “The first rule is Never Believe everything others say. The second rule is Never be sad about something you do not have. The third rule is Never throw away what you have in your hand. ” “Y ou silly bird, ” shouted Chulong. And he added, “These three rules are known to every one. Y ou have cheated me. ” But the bird said, “Chulong, just sit down for a while. Think about all your actions of today. Y ou had me in your hands, but you threw me away (released me). Y ou believed all that I said. And you are sad about not having me. The rules are simple. But you never followed them. Now do you see the value of the rules?” so saying the bird flew away and disappeared from his sight.Acknowledgement - thanks to  Mr. E.

              " 216Unit – 6Hello! I’m Santhiya. I want to write about my mobile phone. I got it from my parents for my birthday two years back. I like it very much and I think it’s sometimes good to have it in my bag.I always keep it in my bag or in my pocket so my parents and my friends can always call me. It’s got a calculator in it so I use it frequently to calculate. It’s also a kind of information file. I can use my mobile phone to connect to the Internet and look through the news or read emails. Isn’t it fantastic?Last year I was cycling with my friend on a holiday with my friend. We went cycling but the weather wasn’t good. It was cold and windy. It started to rain and it got dark. Suddenly my friend fell off her bike and broke her leg. At first I didn’t know what to do but then I thought about my phone. It was in my backpack so I telephoned for help. After fifteen minutes a doctor arrived.Sometimes people are not keen on mobile phones. They are a real problem because they always ring at the wrong moment. I’m not crazy about my mobile phone but I feel safe when I have it with me.Unit – 5It must have been eight years ago. I was at Thiruvarur to attend the Nel Thiruvizha (seed festival) organised by Jayaraman.I went there to volunteer; I’ d heard about him from organic farming pioneer G. Nammalvar and wanted to see if we could bring the varieties Jayaraman revived, to the market.It was just a small affair then; some people attended. But the festival grew exponentially from then on; from 500, the number of participants went up to 1,500 next year; and then to 2,500, 5,000… there was no looking back. When I entered the village Adhirangam where the festival took place, I saw men carrying sacks of paddy, they came with five kilograms and returned with 10 kilograms the next year. That was how the seed exchange worked.I remember how Jayaraman cycled across villages to find traditional paddy seeds and distribute them. I asked him how he planned to carry his vision forward; what would he do for funds. But he replied, “What do I need funds for ? I have seeds and my cycle will take me to everywhere. Or I’ll take a bus” .If people called him asking for his number of varieties of seeds, he went directly to see to it that they got what they wanted. I participated in the planning of his seed festivals.But the man didn’t believe that I was going by a strict plan. He was always cool when those around him panicked. For instance, if I told him there were many people 10th English_Listening Passage.indd216 28-11-202218:30:19www.tntextbooks.in,\n",

If there is no plates we can buy banana leaves; if there’s no food. We can cook and serve rice, we have it in plenty, don’t we?”What if the sound system doesn’t work, I insisted and he said. ”Then we might have to speak louder” . I joked that I would refuse to come for planning meetings, because anyway, he didn’t need them. On a serious note, all the festivals he organised went on smoothly, like he believed .During floods or droughts, he took the collector of Nagapattinam to show him how our traditional paddy withstood the forces of Nature. He visited collectoratesto submit petitions against genetically modified crops whenever he encountered them. Later in life, when his popularity grew, he spent more time in the field; but that’s where his heart was.Hundreds of people called me from India and abroad, enquiring about his health during his final days. He showed that if you worked selflessly for the society, it will give back.“Something is very wrong, ” says the detective.“I know!” says Ms. Gervis. “It is wrong that someone has stolen from me!”The detective looks around Ms. Gervis’ apartment. “That is not what I am talking about, ma’am. What is wrong is that I do not understand how the robber got in and out. ”Ms. Gervis and the detective stand in silence. Ms. Gervis’ eyes are full of tears. Her hands are shaking.“The robber did not come through the window, ” says the detective. “These windows have not been opened or shut in months. ”The detective looks at the fireplace. “The robber did not squeeze down here. ”The detective walks to the front door. He examines the latch. “ And since there are no marks or scratches, the robber definitely did not try to break the lock. ”“I have no idea how he did it, ” says a bothered Ms. Gervis. “It is a big mystery. ”“ And you say the robber stole nothing else?” asks the detective. “No money, no jewelry, no crystal?”“That’s right, detective. He took only what was important to me, ” Ms. Gervis says with a sigh. “There is only one thing I can do now. ”“ And what is that?” the detective asks with surprise.“I will stop baking cakes, ” Ms. Gervis says. “They are mine to give away. They are not for someone to steal. ”“Y ou can’t do that!” says the detective with alarm. “Who will bake those delicious cakes?”“I am sorry. I do not know, ” says Ms. Gervis.“I must solve this case immediately!” says the detective. 10th English_Listening Passage.indd217 28-11-202218:30:20www.tntextbooks.in,\n",
